20152400926916,A hybrid evolutionary algorithm for heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problems with time windows,"Koc, Cari and Bekta, Tolga and Jabali, Ola and Laporte, Gilbert",Computers and Operations Research,2015,Compendex (Engineering Village) ,11 - 27,64,"This paper presents a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (HEA) to solve heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problems with time windows. There are two main types of such problems, namely the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows (F) and the heterogeneous fixed fleet vehicle routing problem with time windows (H), where the latter, in contrast to the former, assumes a limited availability of vehicles. The main objective is to minimize the fixed vehicle cost and the distribution cost, where the latter can be defined with respect to en-route time (T) or distance (D). The proposed unified algorithm is able to solve the four variants of heterogeneous fleet routing problem, called FT, FD, HT and HD, where the last variant is new. The HEA successfully combines several metaheuristics and offers a number of new advanced efficient procedures tailored to handle the heterogeneous fleet dimension. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances have shown that the HEA is highly effective on FT, FD and HT. In particular, out of the 360 instances we obtained 75 new best solutions and matched 102 within reasonable computational times.

ACO is especially suitable for the complexity and probabilistic nature of the minimum time search (MTS) problem, where a balance between the computational requirements and the quality of solutions is needed. The presented approach includes a new MTS heuristic that exploits the probability and spatial properties of the problem, allowing our ant based algorithm to quickly obtain high-quality high-level straight-segmented UAV trajectories. The potential of the algorithm is tested for different ACO parameterizations, over several search scenarios with different characteristics such as number of UAVs, or target dynamics and location distributions.

Probabilistic forecasts of travel time capture reliability and can be used for risk-averse routing, for reporting travel time reliability to a user, or as a component of fleet vehicle decision-support systems. Many of these uses (such as those for mapping services like Bing or Google Maps) require predictions for routes in the road network, at arbitrary times; the highest-volume source of data for this purpose is GPS data from mobile phones. We introduce a method (TRIP) to predict the probability distribution of travel time on an arbitrary route in a road network at an arbitrary time, using GPS data from mobile phones or other probe vehicles. TRIP captures weekly cycles in congestion levels, gives informed predictions for parts of the road network with little data, and is computationally efficient, even for very large road networks and datasets. We apply TRIP to predict travel time on the road network of the Seattle metropolitan region, based on large volumes of GPS data from Windows phones. TRIP provides improved interval predictions (forecast ranges for travel time) relative to Microsoft's engine for travel time prediction as used in Bing Maps. It also provides deterministic predictions that are as accurate as Bing Maps predictions, despite using fewer explanatory variables, and differing from the observed travel times by only 10.1% on average over 35,190 test trips. To our knowledge TRIP is the first method to provide accurate predictions of travel time reliability for complete, large-scale road networks. &copy; 2016 Elsevier Ltd",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2016.10.011,,,Artificial intelligence;Cellular telephone systems;Cellular telephones;Decision support systems;Fleet operations;Forecasting;Global positioning system;Mobile devices;Mobile phones;Motor transportation;Probability distributions;Reliability;Roads and streets;Statistics;Telecommunication traffic;Telephone sets;Traffic congestion;Traffic control;Transportation;,,0968090X,English,Computationally efficient;Explanatory variables;Location data;Metropolitan regions;Probabilistic forecasts;Risk-averse routing;Travel time prediction;Travel time reliability;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1085416667",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

The developed algorithm to make a reasonable management decision concerning the choice of route and delivery schedule gives an opportunity to manage optimally a vehicle fleet and to reduce idle runs. The optimization of delivery routes is based on the minimization of fleet usage, their total run and standing time as well as takes into account traffic intensities on road sections. It allows also to reduce transport load on the road network, which leads to improve ecological situation in the city.

This paper proposes a new bi-objective model for green inventory routing problem with the heterogeneous fleet. The objectives of the proposed model are (I) to reduce the emissions and (II) to minimize the fleet size, vehicle type, routing, and inventory costs. Given the NP-hard nature of the assessed problem, a bi-objective meta-heuristic algorithm based on the quantum evolutionary algorithm is proposed to achieve these objectives.

The overall system design is characterized by a distributed and decentralized structure. Basic idea is to use an evolutionary algorithm in combination with a Monte Carlo method to optimize behavioral patterns of agents. Within an iterative process, agent plans are executed, scored and modified - if necessary. In doing so, a set of activity schedules is created that is compatible with given constraints, such as range restrictions of electric cars or space limitations at charging stations. In so doing agents compete with each other for limited resources within a single iteration step. The proposed model makes use of a map-based approach that takes time variant traffic conditions into account. With help of speed profiles and a longitudinal vehicle dynamic model, travel time and energy consumption calculations are carried out. As the fleet and the charging infrastructure configuration are input parameters of the proposed model, it is possible to perform case studies for several electrification scenarios. In total two different scenarios are explored. First the proposed simulation model is validated with help of measured fleet data. Second the suitability of electric cars for a taxi use case is assessed. Within the first simulation study, the daily mileage is reflected with an average variation of 7.8 % and waiting times with an average deviation of 0.05 %. The second electrification scenario provides transparent indications for choosing both an appropriate electric vehicle concept and charging infrastructure configuration. &copy; 2016 IEEE.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CTS.2016.85,,,Electric automobiles;Electric utilities;Electric vehicles;Energy utilization;Evolutionary algorithms;Intelligent agents;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Iterative methods;Monte Carlo methods;Multi agent systems;Software agents;Taxicabs;Transportation;Travel time;Vehicles;,,,English,Behavioral patterns;Charging infrastructures;Decentralized structures;Electrification;Fleet simulation;Multi agent simulation;Traffic conditions;Vehicle dynamic model;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1071643519",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

Interaction of concurrently flowing local processes follows a mutual exclusion protocol determined by a set of priority dispatching rules determining an order in which competing processes can access to common shared resources. The main problem is in essence to identify conditions deciding about the scale and amount of cyclic steady states reachable in such networks. Such conditions allows one to replace the exhaustive search for the admissible deadlock-free control of the whole network by focusing on its small size parts. The proposed methodology behind fast assessment of cyclic steady states reachable in grid-like structure of cyclic process is clarified through multiple illustrative examples. &copy; Springer International Publishing AG 2018.,inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-62410-5_3,,,Artificial intelligence;Distributed computer systems;Scheduling;Vehicle routing;,,21945357,English,Cyclic scheduling;Declarative modelling;Fleet of AGVs;Multi-modal;Periodic vehicle routing problem;Re-scheduling;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1070023148",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

In a study based on a commercial fleet of 19 buses operating in Kungsbacka, we have been able to predict, for example, fifty percent of the compressors that break down on the road, in many cases weeks before the failure. In this paper we compare those results with a state of the art approach currently used in the industry, and we investigate how features suggested by experts for detecting compressor failures can be incorporated into the COSMO method.

These services are divided into one-way and two-way systems. Two-way systems require users to return the vehicles to their original pick up stations whereas one-ways systems do not. We present a hybrid system that has features of both. Two integer programming optimization models are formulated. The first model, called the fleet size problem (FSP), is for tactical planning and calculates the required fleet size in order to answer all the demand in various market segments where every market segment is composed of some direct-trip and some round-trip users. This model also accounts for vehicle relocation between stations. In reality, however, fleet size is fixed for day-to-day operations. With a specified fleet size, not all users are necessarily served unless the fleet size is quite large compared to the demand. Therefore, a second operational model, called profit maximization problem (PMP), selects from a list of user requests those who profit the service-provider the most. Data from Autoshare, a carsharing company in Toronto, is used to assess the models. Results of the FSP model indicate that one-way systems require the lowest fleet size but highest vehicle relocation hours. Two-way systems are relatively insensitive to the market segment and the hybrid system&rsquo;s performance is dependent on the market segment scenario. The PMP model shows that the one-way (two-way) system is most beneficial to direct-trip (round-trip) users. The hybrid system is the only system without user surplus costs. &copy; 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11116-015-9604-3,,,Artificial intelligence;Commerce;Decision support systems;Hybrid systems;Integer programming;Optimization;Profitability;Vehicles;,,00494488,English,Carsharing;Day-to-day operations;Mobility service;Operational model;Optimization models;Profit maximization;Service provider;Tactical planning;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1082523148",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

This is an important problem of the routing literature which has been attracting the attention of many researchers recently. The mixed load feature allows students from different schools to ride the same bus at the same time. Five meta-heuristic based algorithms were devised to solve the problem, and evaluated on solving four different datasets, one of them being based on a real case from Brazil. Four traditional local search neighborhood structures for vehicle routing problems were adapted and specialized to handle mixed loads and a heterogeneous fleet simultaneously. To the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first time that both features are treated jointly within an algorithm, and not as a post processing optimization step. The attained cost savings and reduction of fleet sizes suggest the suitability of a mixed load, heterogeneous fleet approach for sparsely populated rural areas. Moreover the devised framework has been embedded into a decision support system which is assisting several municipalities of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to better plan their routes and reduce transportation costs. &copy; 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

They are applicable to vehicles that are driven along the same route every day, such as busses, refuse-collecting vehicles (RCVs), or delivery vehicles. Drive cycle identification can be used to identify what power transients can be expected to prepare the power train to operate under these conditions. If the energy management algorithm of a hybrid vehicle can account for future energy demand, then it can be arranged in such a way that the non-fossil-fuel energy sources are fully depleted at the end of the drive cycle. Given that RCVs always drive in similar drive cycles, a drive cycle has been modeled and its main characteristics parameterized. The model is separated into different drive cycles that are related to different power consumption modes. In this paper, a new method to identify drive cycles and the energy left to finish a route is proposed.

The shift from being a purely academic pursuit is highlighted by the introduction of a generic optimization framework which accommodates a variety of attributes that commonly occur in industrial applications. Specifically, the paper's main contribution are as follows: (1) consideration for the following real-world constraints: (a) time windows at customer locations, (b) simultaneous pickup and delivery demands, (c) a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles, and (d) the heterogeneity of traffic congestion levels in urban transportation networks; (2) assimilation of all the above attributes into a multi-objective program which aims to minimize environmental impact, while simultaneously addressing the overall operational costs of the routing solution and service quality concerns; a feat that has not been fully realized by known intelligent systems according to the authors&rsquo; best knowledge. In order to showcase the efficacy of the proposed algorithm, it is first tested on existing benchmark instances and then applied on a pair of real-world industrial examples from Singapore. These industrial examples serve as a source of new benchmarks which facilitate the study of different routing constraints and their effects on the economic and environmental viability of urban logistics systems. &copy; 2016",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2016.09.033,,,Benchmarking;C (programming language);Crashworthiness;Decision support systems;Environmental impact;Environmental protection;Evolutionary algorithms;Fleet operations;Intelligent systems;Logistics;Motor transportation;Multiobjective optimization;Optimization;Real time systems;Traffic congestion;Transportation;Vehicle routing;Vehicles;,,09574174,English,Generic optimization;Heterogeneous fleet;Multicriteria decision support;Real world constraints;Simultaneous pickup and deliveries;Urban logistics;Urban transportation networks;Vehicle Routing Problems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,108275463",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

VANET is an independent network which can organize by itself as both servers and clients for exchanging and sharing information. In multi-fleet system, this acts as a mode of internal communication in sharing information between themselves. This work involves proposals for multi-fleet vehicles using VANET for integrating Wireless Sensor Networks. This is particularly used in sensors that are utilized in determining the fuel pilfering with the other vehicles. Due to frequent change in location and separation, it is hard to plan an effective routing protocol to route data between vehicles which is otherwise called V2V communication and Vehicle to road side Infrastructure. A delay tolerant network based clustering is used in enhancing the quality of service for effective communication between vehicles. Ant colony optimization (ACO)-GeoSpray routing is used to route between vehicles. Through ACO, the best multi hop routes are selected.

In comparison to other green logistics models, this system deploys time-varying travel speeds instead of a constant speed, which is important for calculating the CO<inf>2</inf>emission accurately. This system adopts widely used instantaneous emission models in literature which can predict second-by-second emissions. The factors influencing emissions in these models are vehicle types, vehicle load and traffic conditions. As vehicle types play an important role in computing the amount of emissions, engineers&rsquo; vehicles&rsquo; number plates are mapped to specified emission formulas. This feature currently is not offered by any commercial software. To visualise the emissions of a planned route, a Heat Map view is proposed. Furthermore, the differences between minimising CO<inf>2</inf>emission compared to minimising travel time are discussed under different scenarios. The field scheduling problem is formulated as a vehicle routing and scheduling problem, which considers CO<inf>2</inf>emissions in the objective function, heterogeneous fleet, time window constraints and skill matching constraints, different from the traditional time-dependent VSRP formulation. In the scheduler, this problem is solved by metaheuristic methods. Three different metaheuristics are compared. They are Tabu search algorithms with random neighbourhood generators and two variants of Variable Neighbourhood search algorithms: variable neighbourhood descent (VND) and reduced variable neighbourhood search (RVNS). Results suggest that RVNS is a good trade-off between solution qualities and computational time for industrial application.<br/> &copy; Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-71078-5_30,,,Artificial intelligence;Carbon dioxide;Economic and social effects;Fleet operations;Heuristic algorithms;Learning algorithms;Logistics;Scheduling;Tabu search;Travel time;Vehicle routing;Vehicles;,,03029743,English,Green logistics;Heat maps;Meta heuristics;Reduced variable neighbourhood searches;Speed profile;Variable neighbourhood descent;Variable neighbourhood search;Vehicle routing and scheduling;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1071296296",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

With respect to multiple optimization objectives, PDP-TW-D is to find a set of Pareto-optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles (e.g., mobile robots, drones and autonomous heavy-haulage trucks) in order to serve given transportation requests. The proposed algorithm uses a population of individuals, each of which represents a solution candidate, and evolves them through generations to seek the Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition to the evolution-based global search process, the proposed algorithm allows individuals to improve their optimality in each generation with a local search process, which is designed based on iterative neighborhood search. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of global and local search processes improves the optimality of individuals and expedites convergence speed.

This has created issues surrounding unknown tire pressure and thread depth during active service. There is also no standardization for these kind of systems which means that different manufacturers and third party solutions work after their own principles and it can be hard to know what works for a given vehicle type. The objective is to create an indirect tire monitoring system that can generalize a method that detect both incorrect tire pressure and thread depth for different type of vehicles within a fleet without the need for additional physical sensors or vehicle specific parameters. The existing sensors that are connected communicate through CAN and are interpreted by the Drivec Bridge hardware that exist in the fleet. By using supervised machine learning a classifier was created for each axle where the main focus was the front axle which had the most issues. The classifier will classify the vehicles tires condition and will be implemented in Drivecs cloud service where it will receive its data. The resulting classifier is a random forest implemented in Python. The result from the front axle with a data set consisting of 9767 samples of buses with correct tire condition and 1909 samples of buses with incorrect tire condition it has an accuracy of 90.54% (0.96%). The data sets are created from 34 unique measurements from buses between January and May 2017. This classifier has been exported and is used inside a Node.js module created for Drivecs cloud service which is the result of the whole implementation. The developed solution is called Indirect Tire Monitoring System (ITMS) and is seen as a process. This process will predict bad classes in the cloud which will lead to warnings. The warnings are defined as incidents. They contain only the information needed and the bandwidth of the incidents are also controlled so incidents are created within an acceptable range over a period of time. These incidents will be notified through the cloud for the operator to analyze for upcoming maintenance decisions.<br/> &copy; 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.,inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1757-899X/252/1/012018,,,Artificial intelligence;Automobile manufacture;Axles;Buses;Decision trees;Distributed database systems;Fleet operations;Front axles;Learning systems;Supervised learning;Tires;Vehicles;,,17578981,English,Cloud services;Machine learning approaches;Maintenance decisions;Physical sensors;Random forests;Supervised machine learning;Tire monitoring systems;Tire-pressure monitoring systems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,106400463",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

In past decades, many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) applied neural network and pattern recognition technologies to powertrain calibration, emission prediction and virtual sensor development. The AI application is mostly focused on reducing product development and validation cost. AI technologies in these applications demonstrate certain cost-saving benefits, but are far from disruptive. A disruptive impact can be realized when AI applications finally bring cost-saving benefits directly to end users (e.g., automation of a vehicle or machine operation could dramatically improve the efficiency). However, there is still a gap between current technologies and those that can fully give a vehicle or machine intelligence, including reasoning, knowledge, planning and self-learning. Since a vehicle or machine can be used at different places, routes and terrains, the scope of prediction is most challenging for AI applications in the automotive industry. However, if a machine performs a substantially repetitive work cycle during its operation life, the challenge of prediction can be easily solved by partitioning a work cycle to many discrete segments. Track-type excavators, wheeled excavators, dragline excavators, wheel loaders, wheeled scrapers, and front shovels are all repetitive-work machines. If off-road trucks or articulate trucks only travel between certain locations along fixed routes in a mining site, they can also be regarded as repetitive-work machines. The task of repetitive-work machines requires machines to follow certain operation patterns regardless of terrain. Whenever a machine cycle can be recognized by engine or machine controllers, the operation cost for end users or clients can be dramatically reduced if the AI application strategies are focused on the following four areas: 1)Automation of the current segment of a work cycle2)Adaptive adjustment according to future events3)Global or system-level optimization4)Work site or fleet management improvement through work group cooperation This paper first reviews the traditional AI applications, and then further explores AI application in the four areas by analyzing the related innovations and technology trends. The AI application strategy that can save the greatest operation cost for end users is illustrated as well. &copy; Copyright 2015 SAE International.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4271/2015-01-2860,,,Adaptive control systems;Artificial intelligence;Automobile manufacture;Automobiles;Automotive industry;Construction equipment;Cost reduction;Costs;Crashworthiness;Excavation;Excavators;Fleet operations;Forecasting;Mine trucks;Off road vehicles;Operating costs;Pattern recognition;Powertrains;Trucks;Vehicles;,,,English,Adaptive adjustment;Application strategies;Machine controllers;Machine intelligence;Operation patterns;Original equipment manufacturers;Pattern recognition technologies;Powertrain calibration;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1068865741",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

New positioning and communication technologies, as well as decision support systems for vehicle routing, enable better utilization of vehicle capacity, reduced travel distance, and thereby carbon emission reductions. We present a novel carbon emission analysis method that determines the emission savings obtained by an individual transport provider, who receives customer orders for outbound deliveries as well as pickup orders from supply locations. The transport provider can improve vehicle utilization by performing pickups and deliveries jointly instead of using separate trucks. In our model we assume that the transport provider minimizes costs by use of a tool that calculates detailed vehicle routing plans, i.e., an assignment of each transport order to a specific vehicle in the fleet, and the sequence of customer visit for each vehicle. We compare a basic set-up, in which pickups and deliveries are segregated and performed with separate vehicles, with two consolidation set-ups where pickups and deliveries may be mixed more or less freely on a single vehicle. By allowing mixing, the average vehicle load will increase and the total driven distance will decrease. To compare carbon emissions for the three set-ups, we use a carbon assessment method that uses the distance driven and the average load factor. An increase in the load factor can reduce part of the emission savings from consolidation. We find that emission savings are relatively large in case of small vehicles and for delivery and pickup locations that are relatively far from the depot. However, if a truck visits many demand and supply locations before returning to the depot, we observe negligible carbon emission decreases or even emission increases for consolidation set-ups, meaning that in such cases investing in consolidation through joint pickups and deliveries may not be effective. The results of our study will be useful for transport users and providers, policymakers, as well as vehicle routing technology vendors. &copy; 2017 Elsevier Ltd",article,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.006,,,Artificial intelligence;Automobiles;Consolidation;Decision support systems;Emission control;Fleet operations;Location;Pickups;Trucks;Vehicle routing;,,0968090X,English,Carbon emission reductions;Carbon emissions;Communication technologies;Demand and supply;Pickup and delivery;Routing technologies;Specific vehicles;Vehicle utilization;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1074884259",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

Since the material flows following possible machining routes serviced by MTS determine its behavior the following questions occur: what kind of MTS structure can guarantee a given behavior, and what admissible behavior can be reachable in a given MTS structure? These questions are typical for vehicle routing problems which are computationally hard. Their formulation within the framework of mesh-like and fractal-like structures enables, however, to get a significant reduction on the size. Such structures enable to evaluate admissible routings and schedules following flow-paths of material transportation in a polynomial time. Considered in the paper production routes followed by MTS are serviced by operations subsequently executed by AGVs and machine tools. The transport operations performed by AGVs are arranged in a streaming closed-loops network where potential conflicts are resolved by priority dispatching rules assigned to shared resources. The main problem boils down to the searching for sufficient conditions guaranteeing MTS cyclic steady state behavior. Implementation of proposed conditions is illustrated through multiple examples. &copy; Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-47364-2_42,,,Artificial intelligence;Automatic guided vehicles;Fleet operations;Freight transportation;Machine tools;Materials handling;Mesh generation;Polynomial approximation;Scheduling;Soft computing;Transportation;Vehicle routing;,,21945357,English,Declarative models;Fractallike structures;Material transportation;Priority dispatching rules;Routing;Structure network;Vehicle routing and scheduling;Vehicle Routing Problems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1085185185",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

The resulting Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Three-Dimensional Loading Constraints has to be solved within a single hour, hence the use of a heuristic instead of an exact method. In previous work, the loading was performed after optimising the routes, which in some cases generated infeasible solutions in need of a repair mechanism. In this work, the feasibility of the loading constraints is maintained during the route optimisation. Iterated Local Search has proved very effective at solving vehicle routing problems. Its success is mainly due to its biased sampling of locl optima. However, its performance heavily depends on the perturbation procedure. We trialled different perturbation procedures where the first one perturbs the given solution by moving deliveries that incur the highest cost on the objective function, whilst the second one moves deliveries that have been shifted less frequently by the local search in previous iterations. Our industry partner provided six sets of daily orders which have varied characteristics in terms of the number of customers, customer distribution, number of fibre boards and fibre boards&rsquo; sizes. Our investigations show that an instance becomes more constrained when the customer order contains many different board sizes, which makes it harder to find feasible solutions. The results show that the proposed perturbation procedures significantly enhances the performance of iterated local search specifically on such constrained problems. &copy; Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-51691-2_24,,,Artificial intelligence;Fleet operations;Heuristic methods;Local search (optimization);Optimization;Problem solving;Sales;Vehicle routing;Vehicles;,,03029743,English,Iterated local search;Loading constraints;Perturbation operator;Time windows;Vehicle Routing Problems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1073726852",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

In the VRP, a fleet of capacitated vehicles visits a set of customers exactly once to satisfy their demands while obeying problem specific characteristics and constraints such as homogeneous or heterogeneous fleet, customer service time windows, single or multiple depots. The proposed matheuristic is based on an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm which constructs good feasible solutions. The routes obtained in the ACO procedure are accumulated in a pool as columns which are then fed to an integer programming (IP) optimizer that solves the set-partitioning (-covering) formulation of the particular VRP. The (near-)optimal solution found by the solver is used to reinforce the pheromone trails in ACO. This feedback mechanism between the ACO and IP procedures helps the matheuristic better converge to high quality solutions. We test the performance of the proposed matheuristic on different VRP variants using well-known benchmark instances from the literature.

One way of doing this is to minimize total fuel consumption during vehicle routing. Fuel consumption is directly related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, fuel consumption does not only depend on the driven distances but also on the payload. In this paper, a vehicle routing problem with an unlimited number of heterogeneous vehicles and a fuel consumption-minimization objective function is considered, which was introduced by Kopfer, Sch&ouml;nberger, and Kopfer [9]. It is denoted as EVRP-VC. Till now, the EVRP-VC has only been solved via a commercial solver. Some instances could not be solved within a time limit of 15 minutes. In this paper, a heuristic approach is applied for the first time to the EVRP-VC. An existing column generationbased heuristic is modified. We extend it by a procedure that conceptually modifies some fuel consumption parameters (FCM) which forces the heuristic to generate a more diverse set of tours assigned to different types of vehicles. The performance of the proposed heuristic is evaluated by means of computational benchmark experiments. In total 250 test instances are solved. It is demonstrated that the FCM procedure significantly contributes to increase solution quality. The proposed heuristic is able to compute 87 percent of the optimal (or best-known) solutions in significantly less computing times.<br/> &copy; 2017 IEEE.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285433,,,Artificial intelligence;Benchmarking;Fleet operations;Fuels;Gas emissions;Greenhouse gases;Heuristic methods;Linear programming;Vehicles;,,,English,Benchmark experiments;Column generation;Commercial solvers;Heterogeneous fleet;Heterogeneous vehicles;Heuristic approach;Objective functions;Vehicle Routing Problems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1080902778",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

It is assumed that each BT in a fleet of vehicles starts and completes its route at a blood-bank while visiting a subset of DCSs using the shortest path. However, unlike traditional logistic planning, blood transportation may be time critical. Therefore, in our approach, the vehicle routing is formulated to take into account the urgency of the requests and responses. Consequently, the objective of this study is to minimize the number of BTs while maintaining their minimum traveling lengths considering priority. In this regards, we extended the classical Capacitated VRP (CVRP) and reformulated requests to take into account the priority by assigning weight to each request. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm including Genetic Algorithms and Local Search is used to simulate transporting blood requests of DCSs.

Images will be taken by a vehicle fleet and aggregated on a server. On these images, new strategies for machine learning will be applied iteratively when new data has arrived on the server. The results of the learning process will be models describing the traffic situation and will be transmitted back to the recording vehicles. The recognition will be performed as a standalone function in the vehicles and will use the received models. It can be expected, that this method can make the detection and classification of objects around the vehicles more reliable. In addition, the prediction of their actions for the next seconds should be possible. As one example how this concept is used, a method to recognize the illumination situation of a traffic scene is described. This allows to handle different appearances of objects depending on the illumination of the scene. Different illumination classes will be defined to distinguish different illumination situations.

The LPP method plans a step-by-step shortest learning path for different driving styles to achieve eco-driving, while increasing the driver's acceptance and adaptation of DAS. Simulation results based on vehicle and engine physical models show that the proposed evaluation model, a pure data model, can be used as an alternative to physical model for the eco-driving prompt strategy.

Our study investigates using artificial intelligence algorithms for solving the vehicle routing problem with time windows for a heterogeneous fleet of waste collection vehicles. We present an algorithm and a productive model of the online system enabling comprehensive communication for people that request waste equipment for collection, registering of data and solving the VRPTW.

The study includes the simulation of e-waste collection requests in Tokyo, Philadelphia and Warsaw to compare algorithms for various urban arrangements of streets and buildings. The results show that the best of the four algorithms, to facilitate e-waste mobile collection on demand, is simulated annealing and the worst is tabu search.

However, due to operational challenges among others, many mobility applications still remain niche products. This paper addresses rebalancing needs that are critical for effective fleet management in order to offset the inevitable imbalance of vehicle supply and travel demand. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning approach which adopts a deep Q network and adaptively moves idle vehicles to regain balance. This innovative model-free approach takes a very different perspective from the state-of-the-art network-based methods and is able to cope with large-scale shared systems in real time with partial or full data availability. We apply this approach to an agent-based simulator and test it on a London case study. Results show that, the proposed method outperforms the local anticipatory method by reducing the fleet size by 14% while inducing little extra vehicle distance traveled. The performance is close to the optimal solution yet the computational speed is 2.5 times faster. Collectively, the paper concludes that the proposed rebalancing approach is effective under various demand scenarios and will benefit both travelers and operators if implemented in shared mobility-on-demand systems. © 2017 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/ITSC.2017.8317908,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046252102&doi=10.1109%2fITSC.2017.8317908&partnerID=40&md5=4f97384da7ec42e749cb8d020ea392ee,"Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Operations Research Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Department of Urban Studies and Planning, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Operations Research Center Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems, Operation",agent-based simulation;  deep Q network;  mobility-on-demand;  rebalancing;  reinforcement learning;  ride-sharing,"Fleet operations;  Intelligent systems;  Intelligent vehicle highway systems;  Real time systems;  Urban transportation;  Vehicles, Agent based simulation;  Computational speed;  On demands;  Operational challenges;  Optimal solutions;  Rebalancing;  Reinforcement learning approach;  Ride-sharing, Reinforcement learning",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 20th IEEE International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems, ITSC 2017 ; Conference Date: 16 October 2017 Through 19 October 2017;  Conference Code:135272",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43234,1070023148",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

In particular telematics based real-time driver identification is in interest of entities such as insurance companies, car rentals and public transportation fleet managers. We propose a mechanism for driver identification based on driving dynamics signals currently available in production cars. The system collects and filters sensing data in a sliding window iteration, computes statistical and spectral features and finally provides driver identification for each window frame through a classification process. Finally, a decision function takes individual predictions and outputs a single prediction for the ongoing trip. We evaluate the impact of various elements of the process on identification accuracy, including sliding window size, classifier algorithms and feature sets. Results show that complementing gas pedal signal with steering wheel cepstral analysis improves identification accuracy by 22.4%. We also show that Boosting classifiers provide better predictions for our problem and the best results have been achieved using AdaBoost with 95,89,82 percent accuracies for 5,15,35 drivers respectively.

One way of doing this is to minimize total fuel consumption during vehicle routing. Fuel consumption is directly related to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, fuel consumption does not only depend on the driven distances but also on the payload. In this paper, a vehicle routing problem with an unlimited number of heterogeneous vehicles and a fuel consumption-minimization objective function is considered, which was introduced by Kopfer, Schönberger, and Kopfer [9]. It is denoted as EVRP-VC. Till now, the EVRP-VC has only been solved via a commercial solver. Some instances could not be solved within a time limit of 15 minutes. In this paper, a heuristic approach is applied for the first time to the EVRP-VC. An existing column generationbased heuristic is modified. We extend it by a procedure that conceptually modifies some fuel consumption parameters (FCM) which forces the heuristic to generate a more diverse set of tours assigned to different types of vehicles. The performance of the proposed heuristic is evaluated by means of computational benchmark experiments. In total 250 test instances are solved. It is demonstrated that the FCM procedure significantly contributes to increase solution quality. The proposed heuristic is able to compute 87 percent of the optimal (or best-known) solutions in significantly less computing times. © 2017 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285433,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046117091&doi=10.1109%2fSSCI.2017.8285433&partnerID=40&md5=cc9eea9d4bcfbe8a474cd727c49ecbf8,"Computational Logistics, University of Bremen, Celsiusstr. 2, Bremen, Germany; Department of Logistics, University of Bremen, Wilhelm-Herbst-Str. 5, Bremen, Germany",,"Artificial intelligence;  Benchmarking;  Fleet operations;  Fuels;  Gas emissions;  Greenhouse gases;  Heuristic methods;  Linear programming;  Vehicles, Benchmark experiments;  Column generation;  Commercial solvers;  Heterogeneous fleet;  Heterogeneous vehicles;  Heuristic approach;  Objective functions;  Vehicle Routing Problems, Vehicle routing",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2017 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence, SSCI 2017 ; Conference Date: 27 November 2017 Through 1 December 2017;  Conference Code:134337",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43234,1102083333",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Meroux2018,Policies to Maximize Fuel Economy of Plug-In Hybrids in a Rental Fleet,"Meroux, D. and Tal, G.",SAE Technical Papers,2018,Scopus,,2018-April,"Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) technology offers the ability to achieve zero tailpipe emissions coupled with convenient refueling. Fleet adoption of PHEVs, often motivated by organizational and regulatory sustainability targets, may not always align with optimal use cases. In a car rental application, barriers to improving fuel economy over a conventional hybrid include: diminished benefits of additional battery capacity on long-distance trips, sparse electric charging infrastructure at the fleet location, lack of renter understanding of electric charging options, and a principle-agent problem where the driver accrues fewer benefits than costs for actions that improve fuel economy, like charging and eco-driving. This study uses high-resolution driving data collected from twelve Ford Fusion Energi sedans owned by University of California, Davis (UC Davis), where the vehicles are rented out for university-related activities. The data is analyzed to understand the degree to which the electric battery is taken advantage of by fleet management and end users to reduce fuel costs and emissions. Specifically, characteristics of trips assigned to those vehicles, driver behavior, locations of charging events and missed charging opportunities, state of charge (SOC) at the start of rentals, and segments of trips typically covered by electric driving range are examined. Finally, machine learning techniques, including a decision tree analysis, are used to understand predictors of fuel economy for this fleet. Conversations with fleet management, including presentation of analysis results, are used to generate policy recommendations. We find that due to the typical length of trips, a conventional hybrid would achieve roughly equivalent fuel economy in the UC Davis motor pool, although the plug-in option offers an opportunity to expand exposure of drivers to electrification. Steps for improvement include expanding on-site fleet charging infrastructure, educating users on charging options prior to rental, and consideration of trip destination in vehicle selection for rental. © 2018 SAE International; Ford Motor Company.",article,10.4271/2018-01-0670,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045477359&doi=10.4271%2f2018-01-0670&partnerID=40&md5=1ccf614c05e4bdafeb8fd4d98b81e947,"Ford Motor Company, United States; University of California - Davis, United States",,"Battery management systems;  Charging (batteries);  Decision trees;  Fuel economy;  Fuels;  Learning systems;  Plug-in hybrid vehicles;  Secondary batteries;  Site selection;  Uranium compounds, Charging infrastructures;  Decision tree analysis;  Electric charging;  Equivalent fuel economies;  Machine learning techniques;  Policy recommendations;  Tailpipe emission;  University of California, Fleet operations",SAE International,01487191,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2018 SAE World Congress Experience, WCX 2018 ; Conference Date: 10 April 2018 Through 12 April 2018;  Conference Code:134884",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43234,1151736111",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Interaction of concurrently flowing local processes follows a mutual exclusion protocol determined by a set of priority dispatching rules determining an order in which competing processes can access to common shared resources. The main problem is in essence to identify conditions deciding about the scale and amount of cyclic steady states reachable in such networks. Such conditions allows one to replace the exhaustive search for the admissible deadlock-free control of the whole network by focusing on its small size parts.

Finally, a case study in which the model is applied to a real-world case of a bus line in the city of Beijing, China, is presented. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",article,10.1007/978-3-319-66939-7_29,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85029584412&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-66939-7_29&partnerID=40&md5=c0d083ee94d09d4bbd341fbdc00e43f3,"School of Computer Science and Engineering, Beihang University, Beijing, China; Beijing Transportation Information Center, Beijing, China; School of Information Science and Technology, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China; School of Economics and Management, Beijing University of Chemical Technology, Beijing, China",Bus timetable;  Fleet configuration;  Hybrid sizes;  Load factor,"Artificial intelligence;  Bus transportation;  Fleet operations;  Genetic algorithms;  Integer programming;  Optimization;  Scheduling;  Transportation, Bi-objective optimization;  Crossover operations;  Fleet configuration;  Hybrid sizes;  Load factors;  Non-linear integer programming;  Total operation costs;  Vehicle capacity, Buses",Springer Verlag,21945357,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 17th UK Workshop on Computational Intelligence, UKCI 2017 ; Conference Date: 6 September 2017 Through 8 September 2017;  Conference Code:197879",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8106712963",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures. © 2016 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/CIST.2016.7804998,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85010210491&doi=10.1109%2fCIST.2016.7804998&partnerID=40&md5=82beb77f8e26bde81abfcdea629caa4f,"Laboratory of Telecommunications, Networks and Service Systems, National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Rabat, Morocco",data fusion;  Dead Reckoning;  Extended Kalman Filter;  Genetic Algorithm;  Global Positioning System;  intelligent transportation systems;  low cost;  neural networks;  smart cities,"Air navigation;  Bandpass filters;  Complex networks;  Cost benefit analysis;  Costs;  Data fusion;  Extended Kalman filters;  Fleet operations;  Forecasting;  Genetic algorithms;  Inertial navigation systems;  Information science;  Intelligent systems;  Kalman filters;  Learning systems;  Navigation;  Navigation systems;  Neural networks;  Population statistics;  Tracking (position);  Urban growth;  Vehicles, Dead reckoning;  Differential global positioning systems;  Fleet management system;  I",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,2327185X,English,"cited By 1; Conference of 4th IEEE International Colloquium on Information Science and Technology, CiSt 2016 ; Conference Date: 24 October 2016 Through 26 October 2016;  Conference Code:125733",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8186226852",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Finding such a participation strategy requires solving a multistage optimization problem under uncertainty that entails both an open-loop (day-ahead market) and a nested closed-loop (imbalance system) problem. Driven by the possibility of using data-driven models and reinforcement learning techniques, we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process. Standard methods for solving Markov decision processes, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To address this challenge, we use techniques from approximate dynamic programming. Our proposed method applies a cross-entropy method with a simulation-based approximate policy iteration algorithm nested inside. The cross-entropy method is compared with a separated planning method, that optimizes the day-ahead and real-time decisions separately. The paper presents an empirical evaluation of the presented method for an aggregator with a fleet of electric vehicles using data from the Belgian electricity market. Moreover, it is assumed that the aggregator is a price taker in both the day-ahead and real-time market. © 2016 EUCA.",conference,10.1109/ECC.2016.7810457,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85015070266&doi=10.1109%2fECC.2016.7810457&partnerID=40&md5=ecf8fb58d4573f24cf61ddb058d23793,"Department of Electrical Engineering, KU Leuven/EnergyVille, Leuven, Belgium; Energy Department, VITO, Belgium",,"Behavioral research;  Commerce;  Decision making;  Dynamic programming;  Electric industry;  Fleet operations;  Learning algorithms;  Markov processes;  Optimization;  Power markets;  Reinforcement learning, Approximate dynamic programming;  Curse of dimensionality;  Decision-making strategies;  Markov Decision Processes;  Multi-stage optimization;  Policy iteration algorithms;  Reinforcement learning techniques;  Sequential decision making, Iterative methods",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2016 European Control Conference, ECC 2016 ; Conference Date: 29 June 2016 Through 1 July 2016;  Conference Code:125895",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8229398148",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

VANET is an independent network which can organize by itself as both servers and clients for exchanging and sharing information. In multi-fleet system, this acts as a mode of internal communication in sharing information between themselves. This work involves proposals for multi-fleet vehicles using VANET for integrating Wireless Sensor Networks. This is particularly used in sensors that are utilized in determining the fuel pilfering with the other vehicles. Due to frequent change in location and separation, it is hard to plan an effective routing protocol to route data between vehicles which is otherwise called V2V communication and Vehicle to road side Infrastructure. A delay tolerant network based clustering is used in enhancing the quality of service for effective communication between vehicles. Ant colony optimization (ACO)-GeoSpray routing is used to route between vehicles. Through ACO, the best multi hop routes are selected.

One stand-out example are those systems based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Fleets of such vehicles (drones) are prophesied to assume multiple roles from mundane to high-sensitive applications, such as prompt pizza or shopping deliveries to the home, or to deployment on battlefields for battlefield and combat missions. Drones, which we refer to as UAVs in this paper, can operate either individually (solo missions) or as part of a fleet (group missions), with and without constant connection with a base station. The base station acts as the command centre to manage the drones' activities; however, an independent, localised and effective fleet control is necessary, potentially based on swarm intelligence, for several reasons: 1) an increase in the number of drone fleets; 2) fleet size might reach tens of UAVs; 3) making time-critical decisions by such fleets in the wild; 4) potential communication congestion and latency; and 5) in some cases, working in challenging terrains that hinders or mandates limited communication with a control centre, e.g. operations spanning long period of times or military usage of fleets in enemy territory. This self-aware, mission-focused and independent fleet of drones may utilise swarm intelligence for a), air-traffic or flight control management, b) obstacle avoidance, c) self-preservation (while maintaining the mission criteria), d) autonomous collaboration with other fleets in the wild, and e) assuring the security, privacy and safety of physical (drones itself) and virtual (data, software) assets.

It is assumed that each BT in a fleet of vehicles starts and completes its route at a blood-bank while visiting a subset of DCSs using the shortest path. However, unlike traditional logistic planning, blood transportation may be time critical. Therefore, in our approach, the vehicle routing is formulated to take into account the urgency of the requests and responses. Consequently, the objective of this study is to minimize the number of BTs while maintaining their minimum traveling lengths considering priority. In this regards, we extended the classical Capacitated VRP (CVRP) and reformulated requests to take into account the priority by assigning weight to each request. A hybrid meta-heuristic algorithm including Genetic Algorithms and Local Search is used to simulate transporting blood requests of DCSs. We challenged our approach with symmetrical CVRP instances taken from literature. In this case study, we observed that both the cost and response time are reduced dramatically for emergency. © 2017 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/UBMK.2017.8093532,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040539778&doi=10.1109%2fUBMK.2017.8093532&partnerID=40&md5=a42676850288cc0b15f278820c7862b6,"Department of Software Engineering, Antalya AKEV University, Antalya, Turkey; Department of Computer Engineering, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey",Blood transportation;  Donor/Client Sites;  Genetic Algorithms;  Local Search;  Priority;  Vehicle Routing,"Fleet operations;  Genetic algorithms;  Heuristic algorithms;  Local search (optimization);  Vehicle routing;  Vehicles, Donor/Client Sites;  Fleet of vehicles;  Hybrid Meta-heuristic;  Local search;  Priority;  Priority-based;  Traveling length;  Vehicle routing problem, Blood",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Engineering, UBMK 2017 ; Conference Date: 5 October 2017 Through 8 October 2017;  Conference Code:132116",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8309490741",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,
Svensson2017,Indirect Tire Monitoring System - Machine Learning Approach,"Svensson, O. and Thelin, S. and Byttner, S. and Fan, Y.",IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering,2017,Scopus,,252,The heavy vehicle industry has today no requirement to provide a tire pressure monitoring system by law. This has created issues surrounding unknown tire pressure and thread depth during active service. There is also no standardization for these kind of systems which means that different manufacturers and third party solutions work after their own principles and it can be hard to know what works for a given vehicle type. The objective is to create an indirect tire monitoring system that can generalize a method that detect both incorrect tire pressure and thread depth for different type of vehicles within a fleet without the need for additional physical sensors or vehicle specific parameters. The existing sensors that are connected communicate through CAN and are interpreted by the Drivec Bridge hardware that exist in the fleet. By using supervised machine learning a classifier was created for each axle where the main focus was the front axle which had the most issues. The classifier will classify the vehicles tires condition and will be implemented in Drivecs cloud service where it will receive its data. The resulting classifier is a random forest implemented in Python. The result from the front axle with a data set consisting of 9767 samples of buses with correct tire condition and 1909 samples of buses with incorrect tire condition it has an accuracy of 90.54% (0.96%). The data sets are created from 34 unique measurements from buses between January and May 2017. This classifier has been exported and is used inside a Node.js module created for Drivecs cloud service which is the result of the whole implementation. The developed solution is called Indirect Tire Monitoring System (ITMS) and is seen as a process. This process will predict bad classes in the cloud which will lead to warnings. The warnings are defined as incidents. They contain only the information needed and the bandwidth of the incidents are also controlled so incidents are created within an acceptable range over a period of time. These incidents will be notified through the cloud for the operator to analyze for upcoming maintenance decisions. © 2017 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.,conference,10.1088/1757-899X/252/1/012018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034218557&doi=10.1088%2f1757-899X%2f252%2f1%2f012018&partnerID=40&md5=39237cc999a3e354fcc546f8e18bf22d,"Department of Intelligent Systems and Digital Design, Halmstad University, Box 823, Halmstad, Sweden",,"Artificial intelligence;  Automobile manufacture;  Axles;  Buses;  Decision trees;  Distributed database systems;  Fleet operations;  Front axles;  Learning systems;  Supervised learning;  Tires;  Vehicles, Cloud services;  Machine learning approaches;  Maintenance decisions;  Physical sensors;  Random forests;  Supervised machine learning;  Tire monitoring systems;  Tire-pressure monitoring systems, Monitoring",Institute of Physics Publishing,17578981,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 11th International Congress of Automotive and Transport Engineering: Mobility Engineering and Environment, CAR 2017 ; Conference Date: 8 November 2017 Through 10 November 2017;  Conference Code:131652",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8341666667",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

For this purpose OBD (On Board Diagnostics) signals are recorded in three various car types (BMW X3, Peugeot 208, Seat Leon) and several hundred drives. Furthermore, thousands of drives are simulated based on the Discrete Fourier Transformation (DTF) and Monte Carlo simulation (MC) to provide a huge training data for the rule learning algorithms. The simulated data represents the car fleet with given (or assumed) testing conditions. For example it is assumed, that all the cars of the fleet don't exceed the maximum speed of 170 km/hour due to the specs of the product. All made assumptions are variable and can be changed after the analysis process. All signals (simulated and recorded) are analyzed in order to provide information about every single drive (e.g. out of the speed signal: max speed, max acceleration, duration of the drive are determined and stored in a data base). © 2017 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/RAM.2017.7889775,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018595411&doi=10.1109%2fRAM.2017.7889775&partnerID=40&md5=690c7dc994734b46b879d7643de7966f,"University of Wuppertal, Department of Reliability Engineering and Risk Analytics, Gaussstrasse 20, Wuppertal, NRW, Germany",Field data analysis;  Machine algorithms;  On Board Diagnostics;  Optimization of test procedures;  Testing,"Digital storage;  Discrete Fourier transforms;  Fleet operations;  Intelligent systems;  Learning systems;  Maintainability;  Metadata;  Monte Carlo methods;  Optimization;  Testing, Analysis process;  Discrete fourier transformation;  Field data analysis;  Machine algorithm;  On board diagnostics;  Rule learning algorithms;  Test procedures;  Testing conditions, Learning algorithms",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,0149144X,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2017 Annual Reliability and Maintainability Symposium, RAMS 2017 ; Conference Date: 23 January 2017 Through 26 January 2017;  Conference Code:127094",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8425810185",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

New positioning and communication technologies, as well as decision support systems for vehicle routing, enable better utilization of vehicle capacity, reduced travel distance, and thereby carbon emission reductions. We present a novel carbon emission analysis method that determines the emission savings obtained by an individual transport provider, who receives customer orders for outbound deliveries as well as pickup orders from supply locations. The transport provider can improve vehicle utilization by performing pickups and deliveries jointly instead of using separate trucks. In our model we assume that the transport provider minimizes costs by use of a tool that calculates detailed vehicle routing plans, i.e., an assignment of each transport order to a specific vehicle in the fleet, and the sequence of customer visit for each vehicle. We compare a basic set-up, in which pickups and deliveries are segregated and performed with separate vehicles, with two consolidation set-ups where pickups and deliveries may be mixed more or less freely on a single vehicle. By allowing mixing, the average vehicle load will increase and the total driven distance will decrease. To compare carbon emissions for the three set-ups, we use a carbon assessment method that uses the distance driven and the average load factor. An increase in the load factor can reduce part of the emission savings from consolidation. We find that emission savings are relatively large in case of small vehicles and for delivery and pickup locations that are relatively far from the depot. However, if a truck visits many demand and supply locations before returning to the depot, we observe negligible carbon emission decreases or even emission increases for consolidation set-ups, meaning that in such cases investing in consolidation through joint pickups and deliveries may not be effective. The results of our study will be useful for transport users and providers, policymakers, as well as vehicle routing technology vendors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",article,10.1016/j.trc.2017.04.006,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85018995721&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2017.04.006&partnerID=40&md5=2d289f01eea8d6ebc4ed8fb875c9824b,"CORAL, Department of Economics and Business Economics, School of Business and Social Sciences, Aarhus University, Fuglesangs Alle 4, Aarhus V, Denmark; Mathematics and Cybernetics, SINTEF Digital, P.O.

For instance, integrating fleet management solutions into intelligent transportation systems (ITS) can efficiently resolve transportation problems relying on each vehicle information. Usually, the position estimate is ensured by the integration of the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). For multisensor data fusion, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor’s measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the INS are expensive and require more complex computing which induces restrictions on their implementation. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environmental changes. In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to reliably estimate the vehicle position by limiting the EKF drawbacks. The sensors used are a GPS augmented by a low cost wireless sensor network. When GPS signals are available, we train SVM on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 94% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York",article,10.1007/s11036-017-0879-9,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019559733&doi=10.1007%2fs11036-017-0879-9&partnerID=40&md5=10b6de3e6753ab7f5887134752acc11d,"Laboratory of Telecommunications, Networks and Service Systems, National Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Allal El Fassi Avenue, Rabat, Morocco",Global positioning system;  Internet of things;  Low cost;  Machine learning;  Smart city;  Wireless sensor network,"Air navigation;  Cost benefit analysis;  Costs;  Data fusion;  Extended Kalman filters;  Fleet operations;  Inertial navigation systems;  Information management;  Intelligent systems;  Intelligent vehicle highway systems;  Internet of things;  Kalman filters;  Learning systems;  Navigation systems;  Population statistics;  Sensor data fusion;  Smart city;  Support vector machines;  Tracking (position);  Transportation;  Urban growth;  Vehicles;  Wireless sensor networks, Environmental change;  I",Springer New York LLC,1383469X,English,cited By 0; Article in Press,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,8671180556",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Vehicles start their route from depots, collect wastes from customers’ location, and move to disposal centers to unload waste in the related disposal facility, and then return to depots.

The design of efficient systems for transporting products via a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles must consider the minimization of cost, emissions of greenhouse gases, and the ability to serve every customer within an available time slot. This phenomenon gives rise to a multi-objective problem that considers the emission of greenhouse gases, the total traveling time, and the number of customers served. The proposed model is approached with an ε-constraint technique that allows small instances to be solved and an evolutionary algorithm is proposed to deal with complex instances. Results for small instances show that all the points that approach the Pareto frontier found by the evolutionary algorithm are nondominated by any solution found by the multi-objective model.

The customization method enables companies to incorporate their specific decision-making goals and context into the routing model without redesigning the model itself. The routing model is also capable of adapting its behaviour according to observed interdependences among decision-making goals and routing context.

The TOARP aims to maximize the total profit gained by serving the customers while each vehicle must start from and end at a depot within a permitted maximum traveling time.

The problem is similar to the classical dial-a-ride Problem (DARP) or the pickup and delivery problem with time windows (PDPTW). However, due to the limited resources, not all requests can be met within the time horizon and, therefore, the problem is to select a subset of requests such that the total weight of all served requests is maximized. Additionally, all drivers op-erate on a volunteer basis, thus aspects such as multi-depots, heterogeneous vehicles, and time windows on vehicles also need to be considered.

In comparison to other green logistics models, this system deploys time-varying travel speeds instead of a constant speed, which is important for calculating the CO2 emission accurately. This system adopts widely used instantaneous emission models in literature which can predict second-by-second emissions. The factors influencing emissions in these models are vehicle types, vehicle load and traffic conditions. As vehicle types play an important role in computing the amount of emissions, engineers’ vehicles’ number plates are mapped to specified emission formulas. This feature currently is not offered by any commercial software. To visualise the emissions of a planned route, a Heat Map view is proposed. Furthermore, the differences between minimising CO2 emission compared to minimising travel time are discussed under different scenarios. The field scheduling problem is formulated as a vehicle routing and scheduling problem, which considers CO2 emissions in the objective function, heterogeneous fleet, time window constraints and skill matching constraints, different from the traditional time-dependent VSRP formulation. In the scheduler, this problem is solved by metaheuristic methods. Three different metaheuristics are compared. They are Tabu search algorithms with random neighbourhood generators and two variants of Variable Neighbourhood search algorithms: variable neighbourhood descent (VND) and reduced variable neighbourhood search (RVNS). Results suggest that RVNS is a good trade-off between solution qualities and computational time for industrial application. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",article,10.1007/978-3-319-71078-5_30,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037733998&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-71078-5_30&partnerID=40&md5=75549ab34677f17a2ccf2b282bb00332,"Loughborough University, Loughborough, United Kingdom; British Telecommunications plc, Ipswich, United Kingdom; University of Essex, Colchester, United Kingdom",Green logistic scheduling system;  Heat map;  Metaheuristics comparison;  Speed profile,"Artificial intelligence;  Carbon dioxide;  Economic and social effects;  Fleet operations;  Heuristic algorithms;  Learning algorithms;  Logistics;  Scheduling;  Tabu search;  Travel time;  Vehicle routing;  Vehicles, Green logistics;  Heat maps;  Meta heuristics;  Reduced variable neighbourhood searches;  Speed profile;  Variable neighbourhood descent;  Variable neighbourhood search;  Vehicle routing and scheduling, Decision support systems",Springer Verlag,03029743,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 37th SGAI International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI 2017 ; Conference Date: 12 December 2017 Through 14 December 2017;  Conference Code:207949",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9169444444",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

The resulting Heterogeneous Fleet Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows and Three-Dimensional Loading Constraints has to be solved within a single hour, hence the use of a heuristic instead of an exact method. In previous work, the loading was performed after optimising the routes, which in some cases generated infeasible solutions in need of a repair mechanism. In this work, the feasibility of the loading constraints is maintained during the route optimisation. Iterated Local Search has proved very effective at solving vehicle routing problems. Its success is mainly due to its biased sampling of locl optima. However, its performance heavily depends on the perturbation procedure. We trialled different perturbation procedures where the first one perturbs the given solution by moving deliveries that incur the highest cost on the objective function, whilst the second one moves deliveries that have been shifted less frequently by the local search in previous iterations. Our industry partner provided six sets of daily orders which have varied characteristics in terms of the number of customers, customer distribution, number of fibre boards and fibre boards’ sizes. Our investigations show that an instance becomes more constrained when the customer order contains many different board sizes, which makes it harder to find feasible solutions. The results show that the proposed perturbation procedures significantly enhances the performance of iterated local search specifically on such constrained problems. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",article,10.1007/978-3-319-51691-2_24,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011411979&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-51691-2_24&partnerID=40&md5=8070b4a8b097ffd027e330b6efb0ff07,"School of Computer Science and Information Technology, RMIT University, Melbourne, Australia; Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering, Swinburne University of Technology, Melbourne, Australia; Faculty of Information Technology, Monash University, Melbourne, Australia",3-Dimensional loading constraints;  Iterated local search;  Perturbation operator;  Time windows;  Vehicle routing problem,"Artificial intelligence;  Fleet operations;  Heuristic methods;  Local search (optimization);  Optimization;  Problem solving;  Sales;  Vehicle routing;  Vehicles, Iterated local search;  Loading constraints;  Perturbation operator;  Time windows;  Vehicle Routing Problems, Loading",Springer Verlag,03029743,English,"cited By 1; Conference of 3rd Australasian Conference on Artificial Life and Computational Intelligence, ACALCI 2017 ; Conference Date: 31 January 2017 Through 2 February 2017;  Conference Code:188649",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9193518519",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Since the material flows following possible machining routes serviced by MTS determine its behavior the following questions occur: what kind of MTS structure can guarantee a given behavior, and what admissible behavior can be reachable in a given MTS structure? These questions are typical for vehicle routing problems which are computationally hard. Their formulation within the framework of mesh-like and fractal-like structures enables, however, to get a significant reduction on the size. Such structures enable to evaluate admissible routings and schedules following flow-paths of material transportation in a polynomial time. Considered in the paper production routes followed by MTS are serviced by operations subsequently executed by AGVs and machine tools. The transport operations performed by AGVs are arranged in a streaming closed-loops network where potential conflicts are resolved by priority dispatching rules assigned to shared resources. The main problem boils down to the searching for sufficient conditions guaranteeing MTS cyclic steady state behavior.

Ghosh2017373,Incentivizing the use of bike trailers for dynamic repositioning in bike sharing systems,"Ghosh, S. and Varakantham, P.","Proceedings International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling, ICAPS",2017,Scopus,373-381,,"Bike Sharing System (BSS) is a green mode of transportation that is employed extensively for short distance travels in major cities of the world. Unfortunately, the users behaviour driven by their personal needs can often result in empty or full base stations, thereby resulting in loss of customer demand. To counter this loss in customer demand, BSS operators typically utilize a fleet of carrier vehicles for repositioning the bikes between stations. However, this fuel burning mode of repositioning incurs a significant amount of routing, labor cost and further increases carbon emissions. Therefore, we propose a potentially self-sustaining and environment friendly system of dynamic repositioning, that moves idle bikes during the day with the help of bike trailers. A bike trailer is an add-on to a bike that can help with carrying 3-5 bikes at once. Specifically, we make the following key contributions: (i) We provide an optimization formulation that generates ""repositioning"" tasks so as to minimize the expected lost demand over past demand scenarios; (ii) Within the budget constraints of the operator, we then design a mechanism to crowdsource the tasks among potential users who intend to execute repositioning tasks; (iii) Finally, we provide extensive results on a wide range of demand scenarios from a real-world data set to demonstrate that our approach is highly competitive to the existing fuel burning mode of repositioning while being green.

This is an important problem of the routing literature which has been attracting the attention of many researchers recently. The mixed load feature allows students from different schools to ride the same bus at the same time. Five meta-heuristic based algorithms were devised to solve the problem, and evaluated on solving four different datasets, one of them being based on a real case from Brazil. Four traditional local search neighborhood structures for vehicle routing problems were adapted and specialized to handle mixed loads and a heterogeneous fleet simultaneously. To the best of the authors knowledge, it is the first time that both features are treated jointly within an algorithm, and not as a post processing optimization step. The attained cost savings and reduction of fleet sizes suggest the suitability of a mixed load, heterogeneous fleet approach for sparsely populated rural areas. Moreover the devised framework has been embedded into a decision support system which is assisting several municipalities of the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, to better plan their routes and reduce transportation costs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Wickramanayake201690,Fuel consumption prediction of fleet vehicles using Machine Learning: A comparative study,"Wickramanayake, S. and Bandara, D.H.M.N.","2nd International Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference, MERCon 2016",2016,Scopus,90-95,,"Ability to model and predict the fuel consumption is vital in enhancing fuel economy of vehicles and preventing fraudulent activities in fleet management. Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal factors such as distance, load, vehicle characteristics, and driver behavior, as well as external factors such as road conditions, traffic, and weather. However, not all these factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis. We consider a case where only a subset of the aforementioned factors is available as a multi-variate time series from a long distance, public bus. Hence, the challenge is to model and/or predict the fuel consumption only with the available data, while still indirectly capturing as much as influences from other internal and external factors. Machine Learning (ML) is suitable in such analysis, as the model can be developed by learning the patterns in data. In this paper, we compare the predictive ability of three ML techniques in predicting the fuel consumption of the bus, given all available parameters as a time series. Based on the analysis, it can be concluded that the random forest technique produces a more accurate prediction compared to both the gradient boosting and neural networks. © 2016 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/MERCon.2016.7480121,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978062514&doi=10.1109%2fMERCon.2016.7480121&partnerID=40&md5=c38a4cbbe53a0135e7aac14ba0b12b6c,"Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka",artificial neural networks;  fuel economy;  gradient boosting;  predictive model;  random forest,"Artificial intelligence;  Decision trees;  Engineering research;  Fleet operations;  Forecasting;  Fuels;  Learning systems;  Neural networks;  Time series;  Vehicles, Accurate prediction;  Comparative studies;  Gradient boosting;  Internal and external factors;  Predictive abilities;  Predictive modeling;  Random forests;  Vehicle characteristics, Fuel economy",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 1; Conference of 2nd International Moratuwa Engineering Research Conference, MERCon 2016 ; Conference Date: 5 April 2016 Through 6 April 2016;  Conference Code:121904",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9272800926",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,
Shafiee201612,Agent-based modeling and evolutionary computation for disseminating public advisories about hazardous material emergencies,"Shafiee, M.E. and Berglund, E.Z.","Computers, Environment and Urban Systems",2016,Scopus,12-25,57,"In the event of a large-scale disaster, an important aspect of humanitarian logistics is the distribution of information or warnings to the affected population. This research develops the problem formulation and solution approach for a specific routing for relief problem, in which warnings should be disseminated to an affected community, using public announcement systems mounted on emergency vehicles. The problem statement is formulated to maximize the number of individuals of a community who are protected. An evolutionary algorithm framework is developed by coupling an agent-based model with a variable-length genetic algorithm to route emergency vehicles. The dynamics of interactions among consumers, emergency vehicles, and the spatiotemporal trajectory of the hazard are simulated using an agent-based modeling approach, and a variable-length genetic algorithm approach selects routes to warn a maximum number of consumers before they are affected by the emergency. The example that is explored in this research is contamination of a water distribution network. A fleet of emergency vehicles is equipped with public address systems and is deployed to warn consumers to stop using contaminated water. The framework is demonstrated for an illustrative virtual city, Mesopolis. The results of the evolutionary algorithm framework are compared with two conventional routing optimization approaches, including a covering tour problem approach and a manual routing approach, for four contamination scenarios. The evolutionary algorithm can be applied to route emergency service vehicles to broadcast information for other emergencies, such as flash flooding, hazardous materials incidents, and severe weather. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",article,10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2016.01.001,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84955280628&doi=10.1016%2fj.compenvurbsys.2016.01.001&partnerID=40&md5=dfbe6c7038090bb62f29350eeaf61ac5,"Department of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering, North Carolina State University, 2501 Stinson Dr., 208 Mann Hall, Campus Box 7908, Raleigh, NC, United States",Agent-based model;  Complex adaptive system;  Covering tour problem;  Route alert;  Variable-length genetic algorithm;  Vehicle routing for relief problem;  Water contamination events;  Water distribution network,"Adaptive systems;  Algorithms;  Autonomous agents;  Complex networks;  Computational methods;  Contamination;  Emergency services;  Emergency vehicles;  Fleet operations;  Genetic algorithms;  Hazardous materials;  Hazards;  Optimization;  Public address systems;  Software agents;  Vehicles;  Water distribution systems;  Water pollution;  Water supply systems, Agent-based model;  Complex adaptive systems;  Covering tour problem;  Route alert;  Variable length genetic algorithms;  Water contamina",Elsevier Ltd,01989715,English,cited By 3,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9283449074",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

The overall system design is characterized by a distributed and decentralized structure. Basic idea is to use an evolutionary algorithm in combination with a Monte Carlo method to optimize behavioral patterns of agents. Within an iterative process, agent plans are executed, scored and modified - if necessary. In doing so, a set of activity schedules is created that is compatible with given constraints, such as range restrictions of electric cars or space limitations at charging stations. In so doing agents compete with each other for limited resources within a single iteration step. The proposed model makes use of a map-based approach that takes time variant traffic conditions into account. With help of speed profiles and a longitudinal vehicle dynamic model, travel time and energy consumption calculations are carried out. As the fleet and the charging infrastructure configuration are input parameters of the proposed model, it is possible to perform case studies for several electrification scenarios. In total two different scenarios are explored. First the proposed simulation model is validated with help of measured fleet data. Second the suitability of electric cars for a taxi use case is assessed. Within the first simulation study, the daily mileage is reflected with an average variation of 7.8 % and waiting times with an average deviation of 0.05 %. The second electrification scenario provides transparent indications for choosing both an appropriate electric vehicle concept and charging infrastructure configuration. © 2016 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/CTS.2016.85,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85016933882&doi=10.1109%2fCTS.2016.85&partnerID=40&md5=e95757e2e446041c23c66d59df73aab5,"Institute of Automotive Technology, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany",Charging infrastructure;  Electric vehicle;  Electrification;  Evolutionary computation;  Fleet simulation;  Intelligent vehicles;  Multi-agent systems;  Transportation,"Electric automobiles;  Electric utilities;  Electric vehicles;  Energy utilization;  Evolutionary algorithms;  Intelligent agents;  Intelligent vehicle highway systems;  Iterative methods;  Monte Carlo methods;  Multi agent systems;  Software agents;  Taxicabs;  Transportation;  Travel time;  Vehicles, Behavioral patterns;  Charging infrastructures;  Decentralized structures;  Electrification;  Fleet simulation;  Multi agent simulation;  Traffic conditions;  Vehicle dynamic model, Fleet operatio",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2016 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems, CTS 2016 ; Conference Date: 31 October 2016 Through 4 November 2016;  Conference Code:126763",publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9297685185",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

The solution quality of the heuristic method is compared to cases where an optimal solution is known resulting in an average deviation of approximately 4%. By using this approach, we are able to plan routes for real-world scenarios which are currently unsolvable by general problem solvers in acceptable time.

The classical variation of the VRP is the Capacicated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with the additional constraint that each vehicle must have uniform capacity. Many Decision Support Systems (DSS) have been implemented to solve real life problems of the VRP and its’ variants, but they do not allow multiple decision makers to explore several scenarios of a given problem simultaneously and collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution. In this paper, we extend our previous work [35] and incorporate in our spatial DSS four variants of the CVRP: (i) Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), (ii) Vehicle Routing Problem with TimeWindows (VRPTW), (iii) Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB), and (iv) Vehicle Routing Problem With Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD). This extension allows decision makers to solve specific routing problems according to their needs. The proposed collaborative spatial DSS allows two decision makers to collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution through a tangible interface.

The classical variation of the VRP is the Capacicated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with the additional constraint that each vehicle must have uniform capacity. Many Decision Support Systems (DSS) have been implemented to solve real life problems of the VRP and its’ variants, but they do not allow multiple decision makers to explore several scenarios of a given problem simultaneously and collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution. In this paper, we extend our previous work [35] and incorporate in our spatial DSS four variants of the CVRP: (i) Distance Constrained Vehicle Routing Problem (DVRP), (ii) Vehicle Routing Problem with TimeWindows (VRPTW), (iii) Vehicle Routing Problem with Backhauls (VRPB), and (iv) Vehicle Routing Problem With Pickup and Delivery (VRPPD). This extension allows decision makers to solve specific routing problems according to their needs. The proposed collaborative spatial DSS allows two decision makers to collaborate with each other in order to find the best possible solution through a tangible interface.

Perishable products are routed with lot-sizing, multi-sourcing and limited transport capacity using a homogeneous fleet of vehicles. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and a greedy heuristic have been developed to solve this real planning problem. There are some instances for which the solver cannot give a good lower bound within the limited time and for other instances it takes a lot of time to solve MILP. The greedy heuristic is an alternative to the mixed integer linear program, used to quickly solve some large instances taking into account original and difficult constraints. For some instances the gap between the solution provided by the solver (MILP) and the heuristic becomes quite significant. An iterated local search (ILS) using the variable neighborhood descent (VND) method has been implemented to improve the quality of heuristic solutions. We have included the ILS method in an APS (Advanced Planning System) and have compared it with an exact resolution of the MILP. Two types of instances are tested: models derived from actual data and models built using a random generator of instances that have wider diversity for computational evaluation. The ILS procedure significantly improves the quality of solutions and average computational time is much shorter than MILP resolution. © 2014 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/CIPLS.2014.7007163,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84922584225&doi=10.1109%2fCIPLS.2014.7007163&partnerID=40&md5=3a3458f4b161ad5fcc7b0a069f496cb4,"ICD-LOSI, University of Technology of Troyes, 12 rue Marie Curie, Troyes Cedex, France; FuturMaster, 696 rue Yves Kermen, Boulogne-Billancourt, France",Distribution network;  Iterated local search;  Local search;  Lot-sizing;  Metaheuristic;  Multi-echelon inventory;  Multi-sourcing;  Perishable product;  Supply planning;  Transport capacity;  Variable neighborhood descent,"Artificial intelligence;  Electric power distribution;  Fleet operations;  Heuristic methods;  Heuristic programming;  Inventory control;  Logistics;  Transportation, Iterated local search;  Local search;  Lot sizing;  Metaheuristic;  Multi-echelon inventory;  Multi-sourcing;  Perishable product;  Supply planning;  Transport capacity;  Variable neighborhood descents, Integer programming",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 2014 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Production and Logistics Systems, CIPLS 2014 ; Conference Date: 9 December 2014 Through 12 December 2014;  Conference Code:110093",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9444675926",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

In Fatigue Analysis this is the state-of-the-art data employed for calculating the fatigue life of components. We (i) study the usability of random forests modeled on this kind of data to distinguish between faulty and non-faulty vehicles, and (ii) address the problem of selecting a small number of relevant variables in order to further decrease the misclassification rate and, even more important from our engineering point of view, to identify failure related variables. As our data contains just very few samples of faulty compared to non-faulty vehicles, we furthermore present a framework for tuning the random forest to handle this class imbalance. We demonstrate experimentally for failures of the hybrid car battery that using random forests for variable selection and classification of load spectrum data achieves promising classification performance and enables engineers to identify possible relationships between loads and failures of hybrid components. © 2014 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/ICMLA.2014.71,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84946689435&doi=10.1109%2fICMLA.2014.71&partnerID=40&md5=054bb9f8dd63b0c6e48dbee69c6a170b,"Faculty of Information Technology, Esslingen University of Applied Sciences, Flandernstr. 101, Esslingen, Germany; Daimler AG, Mercedes-Benz Sindelfingen Plant, Bela-Barenyi-Str. 14, Sindelfingen, Germany; Institute for Internal Combustion Engines and Automotive Engineering, University of Stuttgart, Pfaffenwaldring 12, Stuttgart, Germany",,"Artificial intelligence;  Classification (of information);  Decision trees;  Fatigue of materials;  Fleet operations;  Learning systems;  Metadata;  Vehicles, Classification performance;  Component failures;  Fatigue analysis;  Frequency distributions;  Machine learning techniques;  Misclassification rates;  Related variables;  Variable selection, Hybrid vehicles",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 1; Conference of 2014 13th International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2014 ; Conference Date: 3 December 2014 Through 6 December 2014;  Conference Code:110882",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9469328704",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

Efficiency and safety issues become important on the aprons. The ""Integrated Airport Apron Safety Fleet Management - AAS"" project aims at setting a decision support system for efficient and safe management of apron traffic, taking advantage of information gathered by ""intelligent"" vehicles equipped with on-board positioning and monitoring systems. In this project, we optimize the assignment of vehicles to apron operations. We present a mathematical formulation of the problem and sketch a fast sequential heuristic, which provides efficient assignments based on real-time data on position and status of vehicles and operations. We then discuss how the procedure can reach good trade-offs between efficiency and robustness against unpredicted, but frequent, delays occurring in real time at airports. The proposed approach has been applied to a major European airport (Berlin's Tegel), leading to efficiency improvements and reduction of expected delays due to handling operations.

With respect to multiple optimization objectives, PDP-TW-D is to find a set of Pareto-optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles (e.g., mobile robots, drones and autonomous heavy-haulage trucks) in order to serve given transportation requests. The proposed algorithm uses a population of individuals, each of which represents a solution candidate, and evolves them through generations to seek the Pareto-optimal solutions. In addition to the evolution-based global search process, the proposed algorithm allows individuals to improve their optimality in each generation with a local search process, which is designed based on iterative neighborhood search. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of global and local search processes improves the optimality of individuals and expedites convergence speed. The proposed algorithm outperforms two well-known existing EMOAs, NSGA-II and MOEA/D, in relatively large-scale problems that have up to 400 pickup and delivery locations.

Therefore efficient management of the SFPH is essential. There are basically two ways to improve the SPFH performance: to reduce the travelling distance between fields and to design an efficient planning for the transport vehicles. A decision support tool has been developed for silage harvest operations to help farm managers, consultants, and technicians decide which resources they should use to minimise the cost of harvesting operations. The focus is on searching the routes that provide reduced travelling distances for the SPFH by prioritising the harvesting starting date for each farmer, and matching the SPFH and number of trucks to minimise the total cost of the maize silage harvesting cycle. The developed decision support system is compared to a real scenario in a maize harvesting season. Results show that by using the decision support tool, savings of over 15% can be obtained in distances travelled when compared with manual scheduling. Savings over 20% could be made if the restriction of using the starting harvesting dates requested by the farmers was relaxed. Under the conditions tested, if tolerance levels are not considered, the harvesting system is more sensitive to selecting correct transport management approach than to the efficient management of SPFH routes. © 2015 IAgrE.",article,10.1016/j.biosystemseng.2015.04.004,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84928978511&doi=10.1016%2fj.biosystemseng.2015.04.004&partnerID=40&md5=9a8486e119061fc2d76d74d4074ae4ba,"Department of Agroforestry Engineering, Higher Polytechnic School, University of Santiago de Compostela, Lugo, Spain; Department of Mathemathics, Faculty of Computer Science, University of A Coruña, Coruña, Spain; Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Computer Science, University of A Coruña, Coruña, Spain",Biomass logistics;  Fleet management;  Maize silage harvest,"Agriculture;  Artificial intelligence;  Costs;  Decision support systems;  Fleet operations;  Operating costs;  Scheduling;  Transportation routes, Biomass logistics;  Decision support tools;  Efficient managements;  Efficient planning;  Fleet management;  Harvesting operations;  Maize silage;  Transport management, Harvesting, Zea mays",Academic Press,15375110,English,cited By 1,publicações que apresentem soluções para outros modais que não sejam rodoviário,"43233,9983564815","43254,9675578704",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

These services are divided into one-way and two-way systems. Two-way systems require users to return the vehicles to their original pick up stations whereas one-ways systems do not. We present a hybrid system that has features of both. Two integer programming optimization models are formulated. The first model, called the fleet size problem (FSP), is for tactical planning and calculates the required fleet size in order to answer all the demand in various market segments where every market segment is composed of some direct-trip and some round-trip users. This model also accounts for vehicle relocation between stations. In reality, however, fleet size is fixed for day-to-day operations. With a specified fleet size, not all users are necessarily served unless the fleet size is quite large compared to the demand. Therefore, a second operational model, called profit maximization problem (PMP), selects from a list of user requests those who profit the service-provider the most. Data from Autoshare, a carsharing company in Toronto, is used to assess the models. Results of the FSP model indicate that one-way systems require the lowest fleet size but highest vehicle relocation hours. Two-way systems are relatively insensitive to the market segment and the hybrid system’s performance is dependent on the market segment scenario. The PMP model shows that the one-way (two-way) system is most beneficial to direct-trip (round-trip) users. The hybrid system is the only system without user surplus costs. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",article,10.1007/s11116-015-9604-3,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84937761751&doi=10.1007%2fs11116-015-9604-3&partnerID=40&md5=811581e6e5360e4534aef7d6ce9d59b3,"Department of Civil Engineering, University of Toronto, 35 St. George Street, Toronto, ON, Canada",Carsharing;  Decision support system;  Optimization,"Artificial intelligence;  Commerce;  Decision support systems;  Hybrid systems;  Integer programming;  Optimization;  Profitability;  Vehicles, Carsharing;  Day-to-day operations;  Mobility service;  Operational model;  Optimization models;  Profit maximization;  Service provider;  Tactical planning, Fleet operations",Kluwer Academic Publishers,00494488,English,cited By 8,publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9685300926",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

Public buses are an attractive approach to reducing the cars in use, as they mostly depend on preexistent infrastructure. Making these buses electric would mean even less tailpipe emissions and cheaper consumption costs, when compared to conventional vehicle fleets. However, fully electric bus fleets can prove disadvantageous. We can tackle this with a more conservative approach - using mixed bus fleets, comprised by both electric and conventional buses. This work intends on studying how to obtain a good balance of the different vehicle typologies in the fleet. To fulfill these goals, real data of a bus network in Porto, Portugal, is studied and an evolutionary algorithm devises mixed fleet arrangements, with a brief sensitivity analysis giving us an overview of how to improve our results.

The latter assumption is particularly important in an urban context where the traffic plays a significant role. A shortcoming of univariate marginal distribution algorithm for vehicle routing problems is that,customers are not independent events in probabilistic model. Hence,we propose a novel probabilistic model that probability of the distribution of customers delivered by the same vehicle.

Lightner-Laws20162,An evolutionary algorithm approach for the constrained multi-depot vehicle routing problem,"Lightner-Laws, C. and Agrawal, V. and Lightner, C. and Wagner, N.",International Journal of Intelligent Computing and Cybernetics,2016,Scopus,2-22,9,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore a real world vehicle routing problem (VRP) that has multi-depot subcontractors with a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles that are available to pickup/deliver jobs with varying time windows and locations. Both the overall job completion time and number of drivers utilized are analyzed for the automated job allocations and manual job assignments from transportation field experts. Design/methodology/approach – A nested genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automate the job allocation process and minimize the overall time to deliver all jobs, while utilizing the fewest number of drivers – as a secondary objective. Findings – Three different real world data sets were used to compare the results of the GA vs transportation field experts’ manual assignments. The job assignments from the GA improved the overall job completion time in 100 percent (30/30) of the cases and maintained the same or fewer drivers as BS Logistics (BSL) in 47 percent (14/30) of the cases. Originality/value – This paper provides a novel approach to solving a real world VRP that has multiple variants. While there have been numerous models to capture a select number of these variants, the value of this nested GA lies in its ability to incorporate multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles as well as varying pickup times, pickup locations, delivery times and delivery locations for each job into a single model. Existing research does not provide models to collectively address all of these variants. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",article,10.1108/IJICC-06-2015-0018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84960450790&doi=10.1108%2fIJICC-06-2015-0018&partnerID=40&md5=907558fe937a0e370f80f175f80141f2,"Clayton State University, Morrow, GA, United States; Jacksonville University, Jacksonville, FL, United States; Fayetteville State University, Fayetteville, NC, United States; MIT Lincoln Laboratory, Lexington, MA, United States",Evolutionary computation;  Genetic algorithms;  Hard/soft time windows;  Multiple depot transportation;  Vehicle routing,"Algorithms;  Fleet operations;  Genetic algorithms;  Location;  Network routing;  Pickups;  Routing algorithms;  Vehicle routing;  Vehicles;  Virtual reality, Design/methodology/approach;  Heterogeneous fleet;  Multi-depot vehicle routing problems;  Multiple depot;  Multiple variants;  Numerous models;  Time windows;  Vehicle routing problem, Evolutionary algorithms",Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.,1756378X,English,cited By 2,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9756134259",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

With the mass introduction of Electric Vehicles (EVs) the opportunity for DR programs can grow even more. This paper concentrates on a specific type of DR, namely evaluating different scenarios with respect to end-user EVs tariffs. The effects of different tariffs are compared in several scenarios in terms of the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) operation costs and also the EVs' perspective, i.e. considering the optimal use of end-user contracts. To solve the Mixed Integer Non-Linear Problem (MINLP) a modernized optimization approach is used by combining a deterministic method in the first stage, relaxing the problem to a Mixed Integer Linear Problem (MILP) with the use of a computational intelligence method in the second stage, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The case study presents different price scenarios, namely, singletariff, bi-tariff, tri-tariff, tetra-tariff, and Real-Time Pricing (RTP). The network used for this application is a 33-bus distribution network with high penetration of renewables and a fleet of 30 electric buses. © 2015 IEEE.",conference,10.1109/MICAI.2015.25,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987811253&doi=10.1109%2fMICAI.2015.25&partnerID=40&md5=1639715c600508b299d0100820feeaef,"GECAD - Knowledge Engineering and Decision-Support Research Centre, Polytechnic of Porto (ISEP/IPP), Rua Dr. António Almeida, 431, Porto, Portugal",Demand response;  electric vehicles;  energy resources management;  hybrid optimization;  pricing;  smart grid;  tariffs,"Artificial intelligence;  Costs;  Electric power transmission networks;  Electric vehicles;  Energy resources;  Fleet operations;  Integer programming;  Particle swarm optimization (PSO);  Vehicles, Demand response;  Hybrid optimization;  Resources management;  Smart grid;  tariffs, Smart power grids",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 14th Mexican International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, MICAI 2015 ; Conference Date: 25 October 2015 Through 31 October 2015;  Conference Code:120047",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9766898148",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,
Kavakeb201655,Evolutionary Fleet Sizing in Static and Uncertain Environments with Shuttle Transportation Tasks-The Case Studies of Container Terminals [Application Notes],"Kavakeb, S. and Nguyen, T.T. and Yang, Z. and Jenkinson, I.",IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine,2016,Scopus,55-69,11,"This paper aims to identify the optimal number of vehicles in environments with shuttle transportation tasks. These environments are very common industrial settings where goods are transferred repeatedly between multiple machines by a fleet of vehicles. Typical examples of such environments are manufacturing factories, warehouses and container ports. One very important optimization problem in these environments is the fleet sizing problem. In real-world settings, this problem is highly complex and the optimal fleet size depends on many factors such as uncertainty in travel time of vehicles, the processing time of machines and size of the buffer of goods next to machines. These factors, however, have not been fully considered previously, leaving an important gap in the current research. This paper attempts to close this gap by taking into account the aforementioned factors. An evolutionary algorithm was proposed to solve this problem under static and uncertain situations. Two container ports were selected as case studies for this research. For the static cases, the state-of-the-art CPLEX solver was considered as the benchmark. Comparison results on realworld scenarios show that in the majority of cases the proposed algorithm outperforms CPLEX in terms of solvability and processing time. For the uncertain cases, a high-fidelity simulation model was considered as the benchmark. Comparison results on realworld scenarios with uncertainty show that in most cases the proposed algorithm could provide an accurate robust fleet size. These results also show that uncertainty can have a significant impact on the optimal fleet size. © 2016 IEEE.",article,10.1109/MCI.2015.2501552,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84962026684&doi=10.1109%2fMCI.2015.2501552&partnerID=40&md5=977e1eb944bc2f2559fa6071b7afd421,"Dept of Maritime and Mechanical Engineering, Liverpool John Moores University, Liverpool, United Kingdom",Benchmark testing;  Fleet sizing;  Mathematical model;  Optimization;  Tracking;  Vehicles,"Containers;  Crashworthiness;  Evolutionary algorithms;  Mathematical models;  Optimization;  Problem solving;  Surface discharges;  Travel time;  Vehicles, Benchmark testing;  Fleet sizing;  High-fidelity simulations;  Industrial settings;  Manufacturing factories;  Optimization problems;  Real-world scenario;  Uncertain environments, Fleet operations",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,1556603X,English,cited By 1,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43254,9777777778",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

In CVRP, the objective is to design the route set at a lower cost for a homogenous fleet of vehicles, starting from and going back to the depot, to meet the needs and expectations of all the customers. In this paper, we propose an ILS-VND approach which is a hybrid of Iterated Local Search (ILS) and Variable Neighborhood Descent (VND) approaches. Although both ILS and VND approaches, independently provide good solutions, we found that the hybrid approach gives better solutions than either approach independently. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments carried out on widely used benchmark instances. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method outperforms other local searches and metaheuristics. We also, propose a Decision Support System (DSS) that integrates a Geographical Information System (GIS) to solve the problem under scrutiny. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed DSS in terms of solution quality, we apply it for a real case on the city of Jendouba in the north west of Tunisia.

First it applies an algorithm, employing heuristic techniques, generating solutions in a short period of time. In a second step, a graphic interface has been developed, which allows interaction and changes to be carried out in a rapid and intuitive way on the routes generated by the routing algorithm. The route manager can also carry out a broad range of What if'' simulations to find the solution that minimizes cost. With the use of this tool, significant savings have been obtained in terms of the collection time and kilometers covered by freight, while still keeping the current fleet of vehicles. Sensitivity analysis shows that the total cost of the process is more sensitive to increasing truck capacity than duplicating vehicle working shifts.

They are applicable to vehicles that are driven along the same route every day, such as busses, refuse-collecting vehicles (RCVs), or delivery vehicles. Drive cycle identification can be used to identify what power transients can be expected to prepare the power train to operate under these conditions. If the energy management algorithm of a hybrid vehicle can account for future energy demand, then it can be arranged in such a way that the non-fossil-fuel energy sources are fully depleted at the end of the drive cycle. Given that RCVs always drive in similar drive cycles, a drive cycle has been modeled and its main characteristics parameterized. The model is separated into different drive cycles that are related to different power consumption modes. In this paper, a new method to identify drive cycles and the energy left to finish a route is proposed. The drive cycle identification is based on artificial intelligence algorithms, which have been trained and tested with real data with an average efficiency in drive cycle identification of over 90%. The energy necessary to finish the route is based on vehicle energy models and statistical analysis. This method can be used in the daily management of fleet vehicles to replace fossil fuel by electric energy, as is demonstrated in the proposed examples. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",article,10.1109/TVT.2014.2382591,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84947785659&doi=10.1109%2fTVT.2014.2382591&partnerID=40&md5=6f534aa43dfe0bfa757d3c2a1db15296,"Department of R and D, Ros Roca Group, Tàrrega, Spain; Center Innovation Electronics, Motion Control and Industrial Applications (MCIA), Polytechnical University of Catalonia, Barcelona Tech., Barcelona, Spain; Center for Engines and Heat Installation Research (CREMIT), Polytechnical University of Catalonia, Barcelona Tech., Barcelona, Spain",Algorithm design and analysis;  Batteries;  Engines;  Power demand;  Transient analysis;  Vehicles;  Waste materials,"Algorithms;  Artificial intelligence;  Electric power utilization;  Energy management;  Engines;  Fleet operations;  Fossil fuels;  Hybrid vehicles;  Propulsion;  Solar cells;  Solid wastes;  Transient analysis;  Vehicles;  Wastes, Algorithm design and analysis;  Artificial intelligence algorithms;  Average efficiencies;  Electric energies;  Energy management algorithms;  Hybrid propulsion systems;  Non-fossil fuels;  Power demands, Digital storage",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,00189545,English,cited By 8,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43255,0848842593",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

For the prediction of passenger demand in any bus stop, the raw sensor data were pre-processed and several different feature sets were extracted and tested as predictors of passenger demand. The pre-processed data were used for the supervised learning of a regression model that predicts people demand for any given bus stop and route. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved significant improvements over the baseline approaches.

Embodied Evolution (EE) is an evolutionary paradigm that aims to address this problem through the embodiment of the individuals that make up the population in the physical robots. The interest for this type of evolutionary approach has been increasing steadily, leading to different algorithms and variations adapted to solve very specific practical cases. In a previous work, the authors started the implementation of a standard canonical EE algorithm that captures the more general principles of this paradigm and that can be applied to any distributed optimization problem. This canonical algorithm has been characterized already over a set of theoretical fitness landscapes corresponding to representative examples of the basic casuistry found in collective tasks. The current paper goes one step ahead in this research line, and the canonical algorithm is applied here in a collective navigation task in which a fleet of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has to gather red rocks in an indoor scenario.

A challenge herein is the beforehand unknown charging flexibility of EVs, which depends on numerous details about each EV (e.g., plug-in times, power limitations, battery size, power curve, etc.). To cope with this challenge, EV charging is controlled during opertion by a heuristic scheme, and the resulting charging behavior of the EV fleet is learned by using batch mode reinforcement learning.

In simulation experiments, our approach is benchmarked against a multistage stochastic programming solution, which uses an exact model of each EVs charging flexibility.

We assume the capability of a MoD system to be enhanced by deploying robotic shared vehicles that can autonomously cruise the streets to be hailed by users. A key challenge of the MoD system is that of real-time, fine-grained mobility demand and traffic flow sensing and prediction. This paper presents novel Gaussian process (GP) decentralized data fusion and active sensing algorithms for real-time, fine-grained traffic modeling and prediction with a fleet of MoD vehicles. The predictive performance of our decentralized data fusion algorithms are theoretically guaranteed to be equivalent to that of sophisticated centralized sparse GP approximations. We derive consensus filtering variants requiring only local communication between neighboring vehicles. We theoretically guarantee the performance of our decentralized active sensing algorithms. When they are used to gather informative data for mobility demand prediction, they can achieve a dual effect of fleet rebalancing to service mobility demands. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that our algorithms are significantly more time-efficient and scalable in the size of data and fleet while achieving predictive performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art algorithms. © 2015 IEEE.",article,10.1109/TASE.2015.2422852,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027927460&doi=10.1109%2fTASE.2015.2422852&partnerID=40&md5=817863e500faf72c74961765ca02c9ed,"Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, Singapore; Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States",Active learning;  adaptive sampling;  decentralized active sensing;  decentralized/distributed data fusion;  distributed consensus filtering;  environmental sensing and monitoring;  Gaussian process;  log-Gaussian process;  mobility demand prediction;  relational Gaussian process;  spatiotemporal modeling;  traffic flow forecasting;  vehicular sensor network,"Algorithms;  Amphibious vehicles;  Approximation algorithms;  Artificial intelligence;  Data fusion;  Fleet operations;  Forecasting;  Gaussian distribution;  Gaussian noise (electronic);  Robotics;  Sensor networks;  Vehicles, Active Learning;  Adaptive sampling;  Decentralized active sensing;  Demand prediction;  Distributed consensus;  Environmental sensing;  Gaussian Processes;  Spatio-temporal models;  Traffic flow forecasting;  Vehicular sensor network, Sensor data fusion",Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,15455955,English,cited By 14,publicações que possuam evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial em gestão e operação de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43255,089537037",gxferreira,gxferreira,Accepted,

There are two main types of such problems, namely the fleet size and mix vehicle routing problem with time windows (F) and the heterogeneous fixed fleet vehicle routing problem with time windows (H), where the latter, in contrast to the former, assumes a limited availability of vehicles. The main objective is to minimize the fixed vehicle cost and the distribution cost, where the latter can be defined with respect to en-route time (T) or distance (D). The proposed unified algorithm is able to solve the four variants of heterogeneous fleet routing problem, called FT, FD, HT and HD, where the last variant is new. The HEA successfully combines several metaheuristics and offers a number of new advanced efficient procedures tailored to handle the heterogeneous fleet dimension. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark instances have shown that the HEA is highly effective on FT, FD and HT. In particular, out of the 360 instances we obtained 75 new best solutions and matched 102 within reasonable computational times. New benchmark results on HD are also presented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Delivery time cost function is a general piecewise linear function. In this study, we propose a mathematical model of this problem. Then an efficient hybrid column generation-metaheuristic approach is developed. In the proposed algorithm, the hybridization of column generation (CG) and the metaheuristic is performed in both integrative and collaborative modes. In the integrative phase, a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm is used to solve the sub-problems of column generation. In the collaborative phase, the column generation and electromagnetism algorithms are parallelized, and the information from these two algorithms is exchanged to find better solutions.

Our approach to achieve better solutions for the waste collection process is to model it as a vehicle routing problem, more specifically as a team orienteering problem where capacity constraints on the vehicles are considered, as well as time windows for the waste collection points and for the vehicles. The final model is called Capacitated Team Orienteering Problem with double Time Windows (CTOPdTW).

In past decades, many Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) applied neural network and pattern recognition technologies to powertrain calibration, emission prediction and virtual sensor development. The AI application is mostly focused on reducing product development and validation cost. AI technologies in these applications demonstrate certain cost-saving benefits, but are far from disruptive. A disruptive impact can be realized when AI applications finally bring cost-saving benefits directly to end users (e.g., automation of a vehicle or machine operation could dramatically improve the efficiency). However, there is still a gap between current technologies and those that can fully give a vehicle or machine intelligence, including reasoning, knowledge, planning and self-learning. Since a vehicle or machine can be used at different places, routes and terrains, the scope of prediction is most challenging for AI applications in the automotive industry. However, if a machine performs a substantially repetitive work cycle during its operation life, the challenge of prediction can be easily solved by partitioning a work cycle to many discrete segments. Track-type excavators, wheeled excavators, dragline excavators, wheel loaders, wheeled scrapers, and front shovels are all repetitive-work machines. If off-road trucks or articulate trucks only travel between certain locations along fixed routes in a mining site, they can also be regarded as repetitive-work machines. The task of repetitive-work machines requires machines to follow certain operation patterns regardless of terrain. Whenever a machine cycle can be recognized by engine or machine controllers, the operation cost for end users or clients can be dramatically reduced if the AI application strategies are focused on the following four areas: 1)Automation of the current segment of a work cycle2)Adaptive adjustment according to future events3)Global or system-level optimization4)Work site or fleet management improvement through work group cooperation This paper first reviews the traditional AI applications, and then further explores AI application in the four areas by analyzing the related innovations and technology trends.

In the VRP, a fleet of capacitated vehicles visits a set of customers exactly once to satisfy their demands while obeying problem specific characteristics and constraints such as homogeneous or heterogeneous fleet, customer service time windows, single or multiple depots. The proposed matheuristic is based on an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm which constructs good feasible solutions. The routes obtained in the ACO procedure are accumulated in a pool as columns which are then fed to an integer programming (IP) optimizer that solves the set-partitioning (-covering) formulation of the particular VRP. The (near-)optimal solution found by the solver is used to reinforce the pheromone trails in ACO. This feedback mechanism between the ACO and IP procedures helps the matheuristic better converge to high quality solutions. We test the performance of the proposed matheuristic on different VRP variants using well-known benchmark instances from the literature.

In a study based on a commercial fleet of 19 buses operating in Kungsbacka, we have been able to predict, for example, fifty percent of the compressors that break down on the road, in many cases weeks before the failure.

Fleet adoption of PHEVs, often motivated by organizational and regulatory sustainability targets, may not always align with optimal use cases. In a car rental application, barriers to improving fuel economy over a conventional hybrid include: diminished benefits of additional battery capacity on long-distance trips, sparse electric charging infrastructure at the fleet location, lack of renter understanding of electric charging options, and a principle-agent problem where the driver accrues fewer benefits than costs for actions that improve fuel economy, like charging and eco-driving. This study uses high-resolution driving data collected from twelve Ford Fusion Energi sedans owned by University of California, Davis (UC Davis), where the vehicles are rented out for university-related activities. The data is analyzed to understand the degree to which the electric battery is taken advantage of by fleet management and end users to reduce fuel costs and emissions. Specifically, characteristics of trips assigned to those vehicles, driver behavior, locations of charging events and missed charging opportunities, state of charge (SOC) at the start of rentals, and segments of trips typically covered by electric driving range are examined. Finally, machine learning techniques, including a decision tree analysis, are used to understand predictors of fuel economy for this fleet. Conversations with fleet management, including presentation of analysis results, are used to generate policy recommendations. We find that due to the typical length of trips, a conventional hybrid would achieve roughly equivalent fuel economy in the UC Davis motor pool, although the plug-in option offers an opportunity to expand exposure of drivers to electrification. Steps for improvement include expanding on-site fleet charging infrastructure, educating users on charging options prior to rental, and consideration of trip destination in vehicle selection for rental.<br/> &copy; 2018 SAE International; Ford Motor Company.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.4271/2018-01-0670,,,Battery management systems;Charging (batteries);Decision trees;Fuel economy;Fuels;Learning systems;Plug-in hybrid vehicles;Secondary batteries;Site selection;Uranium compounds;,,01487191,English,Charging infrastructures;Decision tree analysis;Electric charging;Equivalent fuel economies;Machine learning techniques;Policy recommendations;Tailpipe emission;University of California;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1059606482",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

Design/methodology/approach &ndash; A nested genetic algorithm (GA) is used to automate the job allocation process and minimize the overall time to deliver all jobs, while utilizing the fewest number of drivers &ndash; as a secondary objective. Findings &ndash; Three different real world data sets were used to compare the results of the GA vs transportation field experts&rsquo; manual assignments.

Originality/value &ndash; This paper provides a novel approach to solving a real world VRP that has multiple variants. While there have been numerous models to capture a select number of these variants, the value of this nested GA lies in its ability to incorporate multiple depots, a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles as well as varying pickup times, pickup locations, delivery times and delivery locations for each job into a single model.

This model aims to minimize the system's total cost by using optimum locations and number of stations, routes, transportation modes, station capacities for different modes and time between stations balancing.

One of the smart city solutions is to establish an efficient fleet management relating to the use of a fleet of vehicles (e.g., ambulances and police vehicles). The most basic function in a fleet management system is the real time vehicle tracking component. This component is usually the Differential Global Positioning System (DGPS) or the integration of Global Positioning System (GPS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS). To predict the position, the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is generally applied using the sensor's measures and the GPS position as a helper. However, the DGPS high cost solution still suffers from GPS satellite signals loss due to multipath errors and the INS require more complex computing. Furthermore, the EKF performance depends on the vehicle dynamic variations and may quickly diverge because of environment changes (i.e, GPS failures by obstructions from building and trees). In this paper, we present a robust low cost approach using EKF and neural networks (NN) with Genetic Algorithm (GA) to reliably estimate the real time vehicle position using GPS enhanced with low cost Dead Reckoning (DR) sensors. While GPS signals are available, we train the NN with GA on different dynamics and outage times to learn the position errors so we can correct the future EKF predictions during GPS signal outages. We obtain empirically an improvement of up to 95% over the simple EKF predictions in case of GPS failures. &copy; 2016 IEEE.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CIST.2016.7804998,,,Air navigation;Bandpass filters;Complex networks;Cost benefit analysis;Costs;Data fusion;Extended Kalman filters;Fleet operations;Forecasting;Genetic algorithms;Inertial navigation systems;Information science;Intelligent systems;Kalman filters;Learning systems;Navigation;Navigation systems;Neural networks;Population statistics;Tracking (position);Urban growth;Vehicles;,,2327185X,English,Dead reckoning;Differential global positioning systems;Fleet management system;Inertial navigation systems (INS);Information and Communication Technologies;Intelligent transportation systems;Low costs;Smart cities;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1061689815",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

BusGrid receives and processes real time data from the automated vehicle location (AVL) and the automated passenger counting (APC) sensors installed on a bus fleet and assists their operator on the improvement of bus schedules and the design of new bus routes and stops based on the expected demand. For the prediction of passenger demand in any bus stop, the raw sensor data were pre-processed and several different feature sets were extracted and tested as predictors of passenger demand. The pre-processed data were used for the supervised learning of a regression model that predicts people demand for any given bus stop and route. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved significant improvements over the baseline approaches.

However, recent work has reported methods of supplying new biomass detection models and concentration locations. These make it possible to tackle reliable collection plans as a part of the decision support system in a biomass supply management information system. This paper addresses the biomass collection problem, as an application of the classical vehicle routing problem, where minimum cost routes have to be calculated for a fleet of several agricultural vehicles (chippers, trucks, tipper trailers and tractors).

Fuel consumption of a vehicle depends on several internal factors such as distance, load, vehicle characteristics, and driver behavior, as well as external factors such as road conditions, traffic, and weather. However, not all these factors may be measured or available for the fuel consumption analysis. We consider a case where only a subset of the aforementioned factors is available as a multi-variate time series from a long distance, public bus. Hence, the challenge is to model and/or predict the fuel consumption only with the available data, while still indirectly capturing as much as influences from other internal and external factors. Machine Learning (ML) is suitable in such analysis, as the model can be developed by learning the patterns in data. In this paper, we compare the predictive ability of three ML techniques in predicting the fuel consumption of the bus, given all available parameters as a time series.

In the VRPHTW,a fleet of vehicles must deliver goods to a set of customers,time window constraints of the customers must be respected and the fact that the travel time between two points depends on the time of departure has to be taken into account. The latter assumption is particularly important in an urban context where the traffic plays a significant role. A shortcoming of univariate marginal distribution algorithm for vehicle routing problems is that,customers are not independent events in probabilistic model. Hence,we propose a novel probabilistic model that probability of the distribution of customers delivered by the same vehicle.

Yet in most cities, plans for snowplowing are developed using simple allocation schemes that while easy to implement can also be quite inefficient. In this paper we consider the problem of optimizing the routes of a fleet of snow plowing vehicles, subject to street network topology, vehicle operating restrictions, and resource (salt, fuel) usage and replenishment constraints. We develop and analyze the performance of three different optimization models: a mixed-integer programming (MIP) model, a constraint programming (CP) model, and a constructive heuristic procedure that is amplified by an iterative improvement search. The models are evaluated on a set of snow plow routing problems of various sizes, constructed using Open Streets map data of Pittsburgh PA. Experimental results are presented that illustrate the differential strengths and weaknesses of each model, and suggest an alternative hybrid solution approach. &copy; Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-33954-2_17,,,Artificial intelligence;Computer programming;Constraint theory;Fleet operations;Heuristic methods;Iterative methods;Operations research;Optimization;Snow;Snow plows;,,03029743,English,Constraint programming;Constructive heuristic;Disruptive effects;Hybrid solution approaches;Iterative improvements;Mixed integer programming model;Optimization models;Routing problems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1080208333",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

In Fatigue Analysis this is the state-of-the-art data employed for calculating the fatigue life of components. We (i) study the usability of random forests modeled on this kind of data to distinguish between faulty and non-faulty vehicles, and (ii) address the problem of selecting a small number of relevant variables in order to further decrease the misclassification rate and, even more important from our engineering point of view, to identify failure related variables. As our data contains just very few samples of faulty compared to non-faulty vehicles, we furthermore present a framework for tuning the random forest to handle this class imbalance.

This problem is modeled as a heterogeneous fleet vehicle routing problem. The main decision is based on the trade-off of either consolidating containers to generate economies of scale with barges or alternatively dispatch, expensively and quickly, single containers by truck.

Embodied Evolution (EE) is an evolutionary paradigm that aims to address this problem through the embodiment of the individuals that make up the population in the physical robots. The interest for this type of evolutionary approach has been increasing steadily, leading to different algorithms and variations adapted to solve very specific practical cases. In a previous work, the authors started the implementation of a standard canonical EE algorithm that captures the more general principles of this paradigm and that can be applied to any distributed optimization problem. This canonical algorithm has been characterized already over a set of theoretical fitness landscapes corresponding to representative examples of the basic casuistry found in collective tasks. The current paper goes one step ahead in this research line, and the canonical algorithm is applied here in a collective navigation task in which a fleet of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) has to gather red rocks in an indoor scenario. The objective is to confirm that the characterization conclusions are generalizable to a practical case and to show that the canonical algorithm can be configured to operate as a specific algorithm easily. &copy; 2015 IEEE.",inproceedings,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IJCNN.2015.7280807,,,Air navigation;Algorithms;Fleet operations;Indoor positioning systems;Industrial robots;Machine design;Micro air vehicle (MAV);Multipurpose robots;Navigation;Optimization;Real time systems;Robots;,,,English,Collective Task;Embodied evolution;In-door navigations;Micro aerial vehicle;Multi-robot systems;,,"43234,0005208333","43255,1086458333",gxferreira,,Duplicated,

For this problem, we compare two different representations of the solutions, and apply EDAs that use three probabilistic models with different characteristics.

In this article, an outline of a concept for image based recognition of dynamic traffic situations is shown. A dynamic traffic situation will be described by road users and their intentions. Images will be taken by a vehicle fleet and aggregated on a server. On these images, new strategies for machine learning will be applied iteratively when new data has arrived on the server. The results of the learning process will be models describing the traffic situation and will be transmitted back to the recording vehicles. The recognition will be performed as a standalone function in the vehicles and will use the received models. It can be expected, that this method can make the detection and classification of objects around the vehicles more reliable. In addition, the prediction of their actions for the next seconds should be possible. As one example how this concept is used, a method to recognize the illumination situation of a traffic scene is described. This allows to handle different appearances of objects depending on the illumination of the scene. Different illumination classes will be defined to distinguish different illumination situations. Intensity based features are extracted from the images and used by a classifier to assign an image to an illumination class. This method is being tested for a real data set of daytime and nighttime images.

To this end, the use a multi-agent architecture is proposed for the management of the different hardware devices, for tracking, messaging and alerts that are produced by the system. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",article,10.1007/978-3-319-61118-1_23,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021653930&doi=10.1007%2f978-3-319-61118-1_23&partnerID=40&md5=35b8279f589af2d6258944613b55d9ea,"Department of Computer Science and Automation, University of Salamanca, Plaza de la Merced, s/n, Salamanca, Spain",E-Bike;  Fleet management;  Intelligent transport systems;  PANGEA,"Application programs;  Artificial intelligence;  Bicycles;  Fleet operations;  Intelligent agents;  Intelligent systems;  Multi agent systems;  Sporting goods;  Traffic control, Comprehensive system;  Control and monitoring;  Fleet management;  Hardware devices;  Intelligent transport systems;  Low-cost sensors;  Multiagent architecture;  PANGEA, Ambient intelligence",Springer Verlag,21945357,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 8th International Symposium on Ambient Intelligence, ISAmI 2017 ; Conference Date: 21 June 2017 Through 23 June 2017;  Conference Code:193429",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43275,1322916667",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,
Woodard201730,Predicting travel time reliability using mobile phone GPS data,"Woodard, D. and Nogin, G. and Koch, P. and Racz, D. and Goldszmidt, M. and Horvitz, E.",Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,2017,Scopus,30-44,75,"Estimates of road speeds have become commonplace and central to route planning, but few systems in production provide information about the reliability of the prediction. Probabilistic forecasts of travel time capture reliability and can be used for risk-averse routing, for reporting travel time reliability to a user, or as a component of fleet vehicle decision-support systems. Many of these uses (such as those for mapping services like Bing or Google Maps) require predictions for routes in the road network, at arbitrary times; the highest-volume source of data for this purpose is GPS data from mobile phones. We introduce a method (TRIP) to predict the probability distribution of travel time on an arbitrary route in a road network at an arbitrary time, using GPS data from mobile phones or other probe vehicles. TRIP captures weekly cycles in congestion levels, gives informed predictions for parts of the road network with little data, and is computationally efficient, even for very large road networks and datasets. We apply TRIP to predict travel time on the road network of the Seattle metropolitan region, based on large volumes of GPS data from Windows phones. TRIP provides improved interval predictions (forecast ranges for travel time) relative to Microsoft's engine for travel time prediction as used in Bing Maps. It also provides deterministic predictions that are as accurate as Bing Maps predictions, despite using fewer explanatory variables, and differing from the observed travel times by only 10.1% on average over 35,190 test trips. To our knowledge TRIP is the first method to provide accurate predictions of travel time reliability for complete, large-scale road networks. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",article,10.1016/j.trc.2016.10.011,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85008230681&doi=10.1016%2fj.trc.2016.10.011&partnerID=40&md5=e972ee464c1d4a29a018cd76c5b49918,"Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, United States; Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA, United States; Microsoft Corp., Palo Alto, CA, United States; Microsoft Research, Mountain View, CA, United States",Forecasting;  Location data;  Statistics;  Traffic;  Travel time,"Artificial intelligence;  Cellular telephone systems;  Cellular telephones;  Decision support systems;  Fleet operations;  Forecasting;  Global positioning system;  Mobile devices;  Mobile phones;  Motor transportation;  Probability distributions;  Reliability;  Roads and streets;  Statistics;  Telecommunication traffic;  Telephone sets;  Traffic congestion;  Traffic control;  Transportation, Computationally efficient;  Explanatory variables;  Location data;  Metropolitan regions;  Probabilistic",Elsevier Ltd,0968090X,English,cited By 12,publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43275,1882638889",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

ACO is especially suitable for the complexity and probabilistic nature of the minimum time search (MTS) problem, where a balance between the computational requirements and the quality of solutions is needed. The presented approach includes a new MTS heuristic that exploits the probability and spatial properties of the problem, allowing our ant based algorithm to quickly obtain high-quality high-level straight-segmented UAV trajectories. The potential of the algorithm is tested for different ACO parameterizations, over several search scenarios with different characteristics such as number of UAVs, or target dynamics and location distributions. The statistical comparison against other techniques previously used for MTS (ad hoc heuristics, cross entropy optimization, bayesian optimization algorithm and genetic algorithms) shows that the new approach outperforms the others. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",article,10.1016/j.asoc.2017.09.009,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031755154&doi=10.1016%2fj.asoc.2017.09.009&partnerID=40&md5=4844a1ef52cbf704f07909426d246693,"Departamento de Arquitectura de Computadores y Automatica, Universidad Complutense de Madrid, Spain",Ant colony optimization;  Minimum time search;  Probabilistic path planning;  UAVs,"Artificial intelligence;  Fighter aircraft;  Fleet operations;  Genetic algorithms;  Motion planning;  Optimization;  Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), Ant based algorithms;  Ant Colony Optimization (ACO);  Bayesian optimization algorithms;  Computational requirements;  Minimum time;  Probabilistic path planning;  Statistical comparisons;  Unmanned air vehicle (UAVs), Ant colony optimization",Elsevier Ltd,15684946,English,cited By 1,publicações que apresentem soluções para outros modais que não sejam rodoviário,"43233,9983564815","43275,2078125",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,

Real-time decision making to act on this information is critical for the success of one-way mobility companies. We show how these companies can predict vehicle demand with high accuracy for vehicles across time and urban areas. We validate this model by tracking the movement and transactions of 1,100 vehicles from the carsharing service Car2Go in Berlin. With our model they could preposition vehicles to increase service levels with a smaller fleet. The accuracy of the model to predict demand area and times is a key contribution to urban mobility systems. Prepositioning vehicles based on expected demand and supply as modeled in our paper are vital to the business models of emerging transportation network companies like Uber and will be indispensable for autonomous vehicles.",conference,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041733346&partnerID=40&md5=9316168ff55a74dcf0c28b8c88e1225f,"Erasmus University Rotterdam, Burgemeester Oudlaan 50, Rotterdam, Netherlands; University of California, Berkeley, 2220 Piedmont Ave, Berkeley, United States; University of Cologne, Albertus-Magnus-Platz, Cologne, Germany; University of Minnesota, 321 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, United States",Business value of IS/value of IS;  Complex adaptive systems;  Data mining;  Decision Support Systems (DSS);  Forecasts;  Green IT/IS;  ICT artifact;  Implications;  Predictive modeling,"Artificial intelligence;  Data mining;  Decision making;  Decision support systems;  Forecasting;  Green computing;  Vehicles, Business value;  Complex adaptive systems;  Decision support system (dss);  Green it/is;  ICT artifact;  Implications;  Predictive modeling, Fleet operations",Association for Information Systems,,English,"cited By 0; Conference of 38th International Conference on Information Systems: Transforming Society with Digital Innovation, ICIS 2017 ; Conference Date: 10 December 2017 Through 13 December 2017;  Conference Code:133354",publicações que não apresentem evidência ou relato da aplicação de conceitos de inteligência artificial ou sistemas inteligentes em gestão de ativos de frota.,"43233,9983564815","43275,2143287037",gxferreira,gxferreira,Rejected,
